In Austria, the government suspended the use of a batch of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca (batch number ABV5300) after a person was diagnosed with multiple thrombosis (formation of blood clots within blood vessels) and died 10 days after vaccination, and another was hospitalized with pulmonary embolism (blockage in arteries in the lungs) after being vaccinated. In Denmark , the Danish Health and Medicines Authority has, based on a precautionary principle, chosen to pause vaccination with the COVID-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca after one person died. Authorities do specify\u00a0it cannot be concluded whether there is a link between the vaccine and the blood clots. Last week , the Philippines Department of Health reported the receipt of 480,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines (not clear if it\u2019s the same batch). Today, health officials released in a press release that there is no reason to halt the vaccination: The DOH and FDA are aware that a few countries in the European Union have recently paused their vaccination campaign with COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca following reports of blood clots in people who received the vaccine. This has been decided as a precautionary measure, while they conduct a full investigation to determine causality between the vaccination and the reported adverse events following immunization. Moreover, the European Medicine Authority (EMA) has also emphasized that there is currently no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions, which are not listed as side effects with this vaccine, saying, \u201cThe position of EMA\u2019s safety committee PRAC is that the vaccine\u2019s benefits continue to outweigh its risks and the vaccine can continue to be administered while investigation of cases of thromboembolic events is ongoing. PRAC is already reviewing all cases of thromboembolic events, and other conditions related to blood clots, reported post-vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca.\u201d At present, the DOH and FDA emphasize that there is no indication for the Philippines to stop rollout of AstraZeneca vaccines. The DOH, NTF and FDA are closely coordinating on this matter. The public is assured they will closely monitor all deployed vaccines.", "report": [{"diseases": "<diseases>", "syndromes": ["thromboembolic", "thrombosis", "pulmonary embolism"], "event_date": "2021-03-12 13:06:12", "location": [{"country": "<country>", "location": "<location>"}]}]},

Both the patients died. The first case of rabies was a 52 -year -old Malaysian man. He denied having a history of being bitten or scratched by dogs or other mammals. However, he once arrested and killed a pet dog in the area of \u200b\u200bhis factory worker\u2019s house on 17 October 2020 after the dog bit two (2) workers there. However, the carcass of the dog was not handed over to the Sarawak Veterinary Services Department (DVS) for further investigation. On 31 January 2021, he was treated and admitted to a ward at Sibu Hospital for chest pain, numbness in his right hand, vomiting and shortness of breath. His health condition deteriorated to the point of requiring respiratory assistance on 5 February 2021. The deceased passed away on 8 February 2021 with the cause of death being due to rabies infection. The deceased\u2019s diagnosis was confirmed positive for rabies through a laboratory test conducted by Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) on February 6, 2021. Meanwhile, two workers who were bitten by the dog have received initial treatment and are still under follow -up monitoring by the health authorities. The second case was a 54 -year -old Malaysian man. On 5 March 2021, he was referred to Sarawak General Hospital (HUS) with symptoms of weakness in the legs, pain throughout the body, fever, nausea and loss of appetite.

Based on the history given, he was once bitten by his pet dog on December 26, 2020 on the right chest while handling the dog. On the same day, this dog was taken by the Local Authority (PBT) for eradication but no samples for rabies test were taken. The victim also never sought treatment after being bitten by her pet dog. The result of Rabies PCR test on his saliva (saliva) sample which was conducted at UNIMAS on 7 March 2021 was positive. The deceased passed away at HUS on 7 March 2021 with the cause of death being due to rabies infection. These two cases are the first two positive cases of rabies among humans in Malaysia for 2021.

There has been a significant increase in the incidence of the disease in these areas during the five years of monitoring. Permanent and holiday residents over the age of three in the area are entitled to vaccinations under the national vaccination program. \u00a0Information on organizing the vaccinations will be communicated separately for each municipality. In addition to the new areas, free TBE vaccinations will continue to be given in the \u00c5land Islands, Pargas, Simo, southern parts of Kemi, the Kotka archipelago, the Sammonlahti district of Lappeenranta, on the island of Preiskari close to Raahe, in the Lohjanj\u00e4rvi archipelago area and in Kustavi. In 2020, a total of 91 cases of tick-borne encephalitis were reported to THL\u2019s Infectious Diseases Register. The number of reported cases increased slightly compared to previous years. Sixty-nine cases of TBE were reported to the Infectious Diseases Register in 2019, 79 in 2018 and a total of 85 cases in 2017. The TBE vaccine protects only against the tick-borne encephalitis caused by a virus. The vaccine does not protect against other diseases transmitted by ticks, such as Lyme disease, and it does not prevent ticks from attaching to the skin. All diseases spread by ticks can be prevented by protecting oneself against tick bites. \u201cWhen you spend time in nature in areas where ticks are found, you should use light-coloured clothes with long sleeves and long trousers and tuck the trousers into your socks. An insect repellent that works against ticks gives additional protection,\u201d says Researcher\u00a0Sari Huusko\u00a0from THL. \u201cIn addition, a tick checks once a day or straight after you have been outdoors in nature and removing ticks as soon as you notice them reduce the risk of Lyme disease,\u201d Huusko continues.

In addition, SC has two confirmed human cases in 2021. The first, recorded in January, was that of a 40-year-old resident of Tai\u00f3, in the Alto Vale do Itaja\u00ed region.\u00a0The second was confirmed in March, being of a 62 year old man, resident of \u00c1guas Mornas, in Greater Florian\u00f3polis.\u00a0Both had no vaccine registration. For Arieli Fialho, immunization manager of the Epidemiological Surveillance Directorate (DIVE / SC), the disease scenario reinforces the importance of vaccination.\u00a0\u201cYellow fever is a serious disease that can lead to death if it is not diagnosed and treated quickly.\u00a0The vaccine is the best way to prevent the disease.\u00a0The dose is free and available at health centers \u201d, he warns. The vaccination coverage of SC for yellow fever is 76%, however, it is heterogeneous, that is, some regions of the state have indices below.\u00a0\u201cEspecially in the places where we have the record of new epidemics, it is necessary that the population is vaccinated.\u00a0In Greater Florian\u00f3polis and Serra we have the lowest coverage \u201d, highlights Jo\u00e3o Augusto Brancher Fuck, director of DIVE / SC. All residents of Santa Catarina older than nine months should receive the dose.\u00a0Those who are not sure if they have already had the vaccine, should look for a health unit to check the vaccination booklet. Yellow fever Yellow fever is a serious disease transmitted by forest mosquitoes (Haemagogus and Sabethes).\u00a0Monkeys, because they live in the same environment as these animals, are the first victims of the disease.\u00a0\u201cThat is why it is so important that the population communicates to health agencies as soon as they find a dead or sick monkey.\u00a0They signal the region where the virus is circulating \u201d, explains Renata Gatti, coordinating biologist for the Yellow Fever Surveillance program in the state of Santa Catarina. The main symptoms of the disease are: abrupt onset of fever, chills, severe headache, back and body pain, nausea and vomiting, weakness and tiredness, abdominal pain and jaundice (yellowish skin).\u00a0When presenting any signs or symptoms, it is important to seek medical attention.
