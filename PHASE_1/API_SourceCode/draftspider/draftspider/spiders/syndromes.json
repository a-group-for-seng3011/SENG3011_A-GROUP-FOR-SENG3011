Twenty cases have been reported\u201312 confirmed and 8 suspected cases. The same genetic profile have been detected in all 12 confirmed cases.\u00a0Preliminary analyzes of samples from the 8 suspected cases indicate that these also carry the outbreak strain. Those affected are aged from 11 to 91 years, median age is 59 years. 60% are women. The infected live in Viken (9), Oslo (3), Innlandet (2), Vestfold and Telemark (1), Agder (1), Rogaland (1), Vestland (1), M\u00f8re og Romsdal (1) and Nordland (1). 10 of the cases have been hospitalized. \u201cThe infected live in many different counties. Therefore, we believe that they are infected through a food that is widely distributed\u201d, says doctor Hilde Marie Lund at the department of infection control and emergency preparedness. \u201cInvestigation work can be complicated and time consuming, and in many cases it will not be possible to find the source of the infection or to clarify whether it is a common source. It is too early to say whether this is a limited outbreak or whether it will increase in scope.\u00a0We follow the situation closely\u201d, says doctor Hilde Marie Lund. \u201cThe high proportion of patients admitted in this outbreak may be related to the relatively high age of the cases (median 59 years), but this is being investigated further\u201d.

As of 6 May 2020, there have been 56 confirmed cases and 6 possible cases of hepatitis A associated with the outbreak since July 2019. To control the outbreak in Victoria, a hepatitis A vaccination program targeting people who use drugs as well as people experiencing homelessness is available until 31 August 2020. As both hepatitis B and hepatitis C are highly prevalent among people who inject drugs, hepatitis B vaccine should also be offered and screening for both conditions considered. People who positive for hepatitis B, C should be encouraged to commence treatment. All adults who use drugs (especially people who inject drugs) or are experiencing homelessness are strongly encouraged to get a free single-dose hepatitis A vaccination from their GP clinic that provides specialized services to people who use drugs and people experiencing homelessness or from the mobile outreach service. People who use drugs are advised not to share or re-use consumption equipment. For people who inject drugs this included needles, spoons, swabs, water, or any other injecting equipment.

Many of the individuals who became sick reported having direct or indirect contact with snakes, pet rats and feeder rodents (used as reptile food) before their illnesses occurred. The investigation is ongoing, and it is possible that other sources could be identified. As of December 10, 2019, there are 92 confirmed cases of Salmonella Typhimurium illness in the following provinces: British Columbia (4), Ontario (16), Quebec (52), New Brunswick (9), Nova Scotia (5) and Newfoundland and Labrador (6).

Both reptiles and rodents can carry Salmonella bacteria even though they appear healthy and clean and show no signs of illness. Even having indirect contact with these animals or their environments can put you at risk for developing a Salmonella infection.
