In total, 2402 salmonella cases have been reported, Officials say the incidence rate per 100,000 population is 5.7, which is 41% lower than in the same period last year. Salmonellosis is an infectious disease caused by a bacterium of the genus Salmonella. The severity of the disease depends on the serotype, the susceptibility of the population and a number of other factors. The source of the pathogen \u2013 animals (cattle, pigs, sheep, horses, waterfowl, chickens, reptiles, cats, dogs, domestic rodents), people with salmonellosis or healthy carriers. Carrier status can last from a few days to several years. The mechanism of infection is fecal-oral.\u00a0Infection occurs through food, water and household routes. Salmonellosis has a summer-autumn seasonality, which is associated with the activation during this period of the mechanism of bacterial transmission. The incidence in cities is 2 times higher than in villages. The incubation period ranges from 6 hours to 2-3 days. The disease can be mild.\u00a0However, in some cases, disease-related dehydration can be life-threatening. Symptoms of salmonellosis: fever, headache, weakness, malaise, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Prevention of salmonellosis should include a wide range of veterinary, sanitary and anti-epidemic measures."},
