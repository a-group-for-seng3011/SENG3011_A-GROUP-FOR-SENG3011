Twelve cases of Salmonella Enteritidis disease have been linked using whole genome sequencing (analysis of the bacterium\u2019s genome).\u00a0Eight of the twelve patients are children under the age of ten and the cases are resident in ten different regions.\u00a0All cases except one have fallen ill on January 20 or later. There are as many women / girls as men / boys who that have fallen ill. The affected infection control units and the Swedish Public Health Agency are jointly investigating the outbreak to identify the source of the infection. In Sweden, less than one percent of all food-producing animals and foods are infected with salmonella, unlike most other countries in Europe, where it is common for, for example, raw chicken and eggs to be contaminated with salmonella.\u00a0In most European countries (except Norway, Finland and Sweden)\u00a0 \u00a0Enteritidis from eggs and chicken is a particularly big problem. In 2019, 1993 cases of salmonella infection were reported, corresponding to an incidence of 19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.\u00a0The incidence of domestic cases has been stable over time (7.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 2019), while the incidence of infections outside Sweden continues to decrease. Of those infected abroad (n = 1215), most were infected in Thailand, Turkey, Spain, Egypt and Greece.", "report": "[<object::report>]"}
