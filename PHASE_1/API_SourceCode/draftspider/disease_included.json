        "main_text": "Santa Catarina already accounts for the death of 64 monkeys due to yellow fever. The latest epidemics (death or illness of a monkey) were confirmed this Thursday, March 11, in Lages (4), São José do Cerrito (3) and Rio Fortura (1). In addition, SC has two confirmed human cases in 2021. The first, recorded in January, was that of a 40-year-old resident of Taió, in the Alto Vale do Itajaí region. The second was confirmed in March, being of a 62 year old man, resident of Águas Mornas, in Greater Florianópolis. Both had no vaccine registration. For Arieli Fialho, immunization manager of the Epidemiological Surveillance Directorate (DIVE / SC), the disease scenario reinforces the importance of vaccination. “Yellow fever is a serious disease that can lead to death if it is not diagnosed and treated quickly. The vaccine is the best way to prevent the disease. The dose is free and available at health centers ”, he warns. The vaccination coverage of SC for yellow fever is 76%, however, it is heterogeneous, that is, some regions of the state have indices below. “Especially in the places where we have the record of new epidemics, it is necessary that the population is vaccinated. In Greater Florianópolis and Serra we have the lowest coverage ”, highlights João Augusto Brancher Fuck, director of DIVE / SC. All residents of Santa Catarina older than nine months should receive the dose. Those who are not sure if they have already had the vaccine, should look for a health unit to check the vaccination booklet. Yellow fever is a serious disease transmitted by forest mosquitoes (Haemagogus and Sabethes). Monkeys, because they live in the same environment as these animals, are the first victims of the disease. “That is why it is so important that the population communicates to health agencies as soon as they find a dead or sick monkey. They signal the region where the virus is circulating ”, explains Renata Gatti, coordinating biologist for the Yellow Fever Surveillance program in the state of Santa Catarina. The main symptoms of the disease are: abrupt onset of fever, chills, severe headache, back and body pain, nausea and vomiting, weakness and tiredness, abdominal pain and jaundice (yellowish skin). When presenting any signs or symptoms, it is important to seek medical attention. \n",

The first case of rabies was a 52 -year -old Malaysian man. He denied having a history of being bitten or scratched by dogs or other mammals. However, he once arrested and killed a pet dog in the area of ​​his factory worker’s house on 17 October 2020 after the dog bit two (2) workers there. However, the carcass of the dog was not handed over to the Sarawak Veterinary Services Department (DVS) for further investigation. On 31 January 2021, he was treated and admitted to a ward at Sibu Hospital for chest pain, numbness in his right hand, vomiting and shortness of breath. His health condition deteriorated to the point of requiring respiratory assistance on 5 February 2021. The deceased passed away on 8 February 2021 with the cause of death being due to rabies infection. The deceased’s diagnosis was confirmed positive for rabies through a laboratory test conducted by Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) on February 6, 2021. Meanwhile, two workers who were bitten by the dog have received initial treatment and are still under follow -up monitoring by the health authorities. The second case was a 54 -year -old Malaysian man. On 5 March 2021, he was referred to Sarawak General Hospital (HUS) with symptoms of weakness in the legs, pain throughout the body, fever, nausea and loss of appetite. His health condition deteriorated to the point of needing a respirator on March 7, 2021. Based on the history given, he was once bitten by his pet dog on December 26, 2020 on the right chest while handling the dog. On the same day, this dog was taken by the Local Authority (PBT) for eradication but no samples for rabies test were taken. The victim also never sought treatment after being bitten by her pet dog. The result of Rabies PCR test on his saliva (saliva) sample which was conducted at UNIMAS on 7 March 2021 was positive. The deceased passed away at HUS on 7 March 2021 with the cause of death being due to rabies infection. These two cases are the first two positive cases of rabies among humans in Malaysia for 2021. The addition of these two (2) new cases makes the total number of cases since the rabies outbreak was declared in Sarawak on 1 July 2017 is 33 cases with 31 deaths. There were only two (2) surviving cases and both were children with a history of early treatment.",

        "main_text": "Finland health officials (THL) report the vaccination program against tick-borne encephalitis will be extended to Luoma area in Kirkkonummi and to a part of the Sipoo archipelago. There has been a significant increase in the incidence of the disease in these areas during the five years of monitoring. Permanent and holiday residents over the age of three in the area are entitled to vaccinations under the national vaccination program.  Information on organizing the vaccinations will be communicated separately for each municipality. In addition to the new areas, free TBE vaccinations will continue to be given in the Åland Islands, Pargas, Simo, southern parts of Kemi, the Kotka archipelago, the Sammonlahti district of Lappeenranta, on the island of Preiskari close to Raahe, in the Lohjanjärvi archipelago area and in Kustavi. In 2020, a total of 91 cases of tick-borne encephalitis were reported to THL’s Infectious Diseases Register. The number of reported cases increased slightly compared to previous years. Sixty-nine cases of TBE were reported to the Infectious Diseases Register in 2019, 79 in 2018 and a total of 85 cases in 2017. The TBE vaccine protects only against the tick-borne encephalitis caused by a virus. The vaccine does not protect against other diseases transmitted by ticks, such as Lyme disease, and it does not prevent ticks from attaching to the skin. All diseases spread by ticks can be prevented by protecting oneself against tick bites. “When you spend time in nature in areas where ticks are found, you should use light-coloured clothes with long sleeves and long trousers and tuck the trousers into your socks. An insect repellent that works against ticks gives additional protection,” says Researcher Sari Huusko from THL. “In addition, a tick checks once a day or straight after you have been outdoors in nature and removing ticks as soon as you notice them reduce the risk of Lyme disease,” Huusko continues.    ",
