        "main_text": "In a follow-up on the Salmonella Enteritidis in Sweden, The Swedish Public Health Agency have now reported 25 confirmed cases across 14 regions in the southern and central parts of the country since December 2020. 72% of cases are children under 10 years (n = 18), 16% of cases are over 70 years (n = 4). The distribution between the sexes is even, except for cases over the age of 70 where all are men. The infection control units concerned, the Swedish Public Health Agency and the National Food Administration are jointly investigating the outbreak to identify the source of the infection. Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.",

They are threatening to go on strike to decry the insignificant salary scale. “We have been in Katwa with the provincial minister of health to listen to the providers, to understand exactly what is wrong. It is because the providers told us that the fixed scale is low. You know, EVD (Ebola Virus Disease) is managed nationally and even locally. Having felt that this was a well-founded problem, the Minister of Health decided to go to Goma to share the information with the governor. Of course we will relay at the national level. It is up to providers to take their trouble patiently, ” added Doctor Guy Makelele.

        "main_text": "German health officials decided to resume the use of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine Friday after the European Medicines Agency (EMA) reported Thursday that the benefits of getting the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca still outweigh the risks. “We have to remain cautious, prudent and pragmatic: with the decisions on AstraZeneca we did just that,” said Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn on Friday at the federal press conference. As a precautionary measure, the vaccination was suspended after the Paul Ehrlich Institute recommended this procedure due to a number of worrying events.” SPD health expert Prof. Dr. Karl Lauterbach welcomes the fact that AstraZeneca is being vaccinated again: “From the patient’s perspective, the cost-benefit ratio of this vaccine is excellent. The complication occurs in less than 1 in 100,000 patients. ”The benefit of the vaccine has been proven particularly in large field studies. He could very safely prevent hospitalization and death in the elderly. “It is not a second-class vaccine,” said Lauterbach. Meanwhile, the number of infections is rising again significantly: “We are in the third wave of the pandemic. So there are still quite challenging weeks ahead of us. Vaccination is a key step here, but it takes time.” The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 16,033 to 2,645,783, according to data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). The reported death toll rose by 207 to 74,565. Every 10th adult in Germany is now vaccinated.",

The measures in place for all travelers are compliance with the mandatory 10-day quarantine, without the possibility of exemption, once they arrive in Chile; isolation in health residence for 11 days for those who have a positive PCR test within the first 14 days of entering the country, in turn, travelers who have at least one or two symptoms of COVID-19 must attend a residence until it is discarded. Regarding travelers who come from Brazil or who have been in that country during the last 14 days, they must go to a Transit Hotel and can leave only if their CRP is negative. However, 10-day quarantine compliance is mandatory. Likewise, all the costs associated with their entry must be paid by the same traveler when taking out their health passport, at the time they take their plane to Chile.

During the period January and up to the beginning of February, twice as many people fell ill with Yersinia infection as during the same period in a normal year. Of a total of 53 cases of Yersinia enterocolitica, 33 were resident in the regions of Stockholm, Västra Götaland and Halland. Isolates from 24 of these cases were typed by whole genome sequencing, ie analysis of the bacterium’s genome, and 16 outbreak cases with clustered isolates could be identified. The Swedish Public Health Agency and the infection control units have collaborated on interviews with sick people and compilation of questionnaire responses about what and where they ate before the illness. A so-called case-case study where questionnaire responses from outbreak cases were compared with questionnaire responses from disease cases with Yersinia infection that did not belong to the outbreak, it emerged that the outbreak cases had to a greater extent visited one and the same restaurant chain. A contaminated batch of iceberg lettuce distributed to a restaurant chain is the suspected source of infection.",

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) presented their assessment of the vaccine this Thursday saying the benefits of getting the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca still outweigh the risks despite possible link to rare blood clots with low blood platelets. “We take EMA’s assessment into account. Due to the situation with several serious cases in Norway, we want to thoroughly review the situation before we make a conclusion. This will take some time, and we will provide an update at the end of next week,” says Geir Bukholm, Director of the Division of Infection Control at the NIPH. The NIPH is asking anyone who has had the AstraZeneca vaccine and who feels unwell over time, has unusual bruising or signs of bleeding in the skin or other signs of serious illness to contact the health service for an assessment. The patients who had severe blood clots, hemorrhages and low platelet counts developed symptoms within 14 days of vaccination.",

The consumption of “Real Water” brand alkaline water is the only common link identified between all of these cases to date. This brand of alkaline water is owned by Real Water Inc., headquartered in Mesa, Arizona. Frank Yiannas, Deputy Commissioner for Food Policy and Response said, “The FDA is committed to protecting the health of Americans and is especially concerned when there is a food safety issue impacting our youngest, and some of the most vulnerable in the population – infants and young children. Upon learning about reports of acute non-viral hepatitis in Nevada, impacting five young children, the FDA quickly activated a team to further investigate. We are working closely with the CDC, state and local partners to complete our investigation and monitor for any additional illnesses. “We are advising consumers, restaurants and retailers to not consume, cook with, sell or serve “Real Water” alkaline water until more information is known about the cause of the illnesses. We are working to determine how the alkaline water may be related to the illnesses. Although the investigation is ongoing, CDC’s analysis of epidemiologic information indicates that this alkaline water product may be the cause of the illnesses. We will provide additional updates as more information becomes available.”",

        "main_text": "Last year, more than 10 million PCR tests were performed in Denmark. Four million Danes had at least one test done. Researchers at the Statens Serum Institut (SSI) have now analysed patterns in these test data with a focus on the individuals who tested positive more than once. The data were used to estimate the degree of protection against a new infection after a past infection. The study has been published in the medical journal The Lancet. In the analysis, the researchers identified those who were tested by PCR in the first epidemic wave in the spring and looked at their test results, if any, during the second wave in the autumn and winter of 2020. The analysis showed that among those who tested positive during the first wave, 0.65% tested positive again during the second wave. By comparison, 3.3% of those who tested negative in the first wave had a positive test during the second wave. Those who had not previously tested positive were thus roughly five times more likely to test positive later on. This corresponded to an 80.5% degree of protection against a later infection. There was no difference in protection between males and females. There was also no difference between the first part and the last part of the study period. That is, there was no sign that protection began to wane after six months. However, when dividing the population into age groups, a different pattern emerged for the senior age group. Among those aged 65 years and above, the protection was estimated to be just 47%. “We estimated protection after natural infection to be 80% in the population overall. But we also saw that this figure, what we may call the observed immunity, was markedly lower in the older age segment, being just 50% or lower. ” said senior researcher Steen Ethelberg who together with colleagues from the SSI conducted the study. Steen Ethelberg continued: “Our study suggests that most people will be protected from being infected again for at least half a year. But not everyone is protected and especially among the elderly, only about half appeared to be protected after a first infection. Even if you have already been infected, our findings suggest that it is advisable to keep following the general advice on how to protect yourself from infection. Furthermore, the findings highlight the need to vaccinate all, since natural protection – especially among the elderly – cannot be relied upon.”",

        "main_text": "European health authorities have reported 22 cases of thromboembolic events (blood clots) had been reported among the 3 million people vaccinated with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca in the European Economic Area. In Austria, the government suspended the use of a batch of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca (batch number ABV5300) after a person was diagnosed with multiple thrombosis (formation of blood clots within blood vessels) and died 10 days after vaccination, and another was hospitalized with pulmonary embolism (blockage in arteries in the lungs) after being vaccinated. In Denmark , the Danish Health and Medicines Authority has, based on a precautionary principle, chosen to pause vaccination with the COVID-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca after one person died. Authorities do specify it cannot be concluded whether there is a link between the vaccine and the blood clots. Last week , the Philippines Department of Health reported the receipt of 480,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines (not clear if it’s the same batch). Today, health officials released in a press release that there is no reason to halt the vaccination: The DOH and FDA are aware that a few countries in the European Union have recently paused their vaccination campaign with COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca following reports of blood clots in people who received the vaccine. This has been decided as a precautionary measure, while they conduct a full investigation to determine causality between the vaccination and the reported adverse events following immunization. Moreover, the European Medicine Authority (EMA) has also emphasized that there is currently no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions, which are not listed as side effects with this vaccine, saying, “The position of EMA’s safety committee PRAC is that the vaccine’s benefits continue to outweigh its risks and the vaccine can continue to be administered while investigation of cases of thromboembolic events is ongoing. PRAC is already reviewing all cases of thromboembolic events, and other conditions related to blood clots, reported post-vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca.” At present, the DOH and FDA emphasize that there is no indication for the Philippines to stop rollout of AstraZeneca vaccines. The DOH, NTF and FDA are closely coordinating on this matter. The public is assured they will closely monitor all deployed vaccines.",

Of these five cases, all were primary cases, of whom three reported contact with camels. These five cases were reported in Riyadh (2), Makkah (2) and Eastern Province (1). Of the five cases, three were fatal. MERS is viral respiratory illness that was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has since spread to several other countries (26). Most people confirmed to have MERS-CoV infection have had severe respiratory illness with symptoms of: fever, cough and shortness of breath. Some people also had diarrhea and nausea/vomiting. For many people with MERS, more severe complications followed, such as pneumonia and kidney failure. About 3 or 4 out of every 10 people reported with MERS have died. Most of the people who died had a pre-existing medical condition that weakened their immune system, or an underlying medical condition that hadn’t yet been discovered.

Twenty cases have been reported–12 confirmed and 8 suspected cases. The same genetic profile have been detected in all 12 confirmed cases. Preliminary analyzes of samples from the 8 suspected cases indicate that these also carry the outbreak strain. Those affected are aged from 11 to 91 years, median age is 59 years. 60% are women. The infected live in Viken (9), Oslo (3), Innlandet (2), Vestfold and Telemark (1), Agder (1), Rogaland (1), Vestland (1), Møre og Romsdal (1) and Nordland (1). 10 of the cases have been hospitalized. “The infected live in many different counties. Therefore, we believe that they are infected through a food that is widely distributed”, says doctor Hilde Marie Lund at the department of infection control and emergency preparedness. “Investigation work can be complicated and time consuming, and in many cases it will not be possible to find the source of the infection or to clarify whether it is a common source. It is too early to say whether this is a limited outbreak or whether it will increase in scope. We follow the situation closely”, says doctor Hilde Marie Lund. “The high proportion of patients admitted in this outbreak may be related to the relatively high age of the cases (median 59 years), but this is being investigated further”.

        "main_text": "On March 10, 2020, the first cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in Bolivia, days later the Jeanine Áñez regime established a rigid quarantine followed by improvised measures, unlike the Plan Strategy for the Fight against COVID-19 implemented by the Government of President Luis Arce Catacora based on three pillars: early diagnosis, coordination at all levels and mass vaccination. “The first wave was characterized by a single strategy: rigid quarantine, which, although it may have had an effect on the health system, negatively affected the economy of the country and that of the Bolivian people, since it is seen that a large part of our population percentage is dedicated to informality, ”said the Minister of Health and Sports, Jeyson Auza Pinto, in an assessment of the pandemic in Bolivia. He indicated that in the first wave a total of 144,000 cases were registered, versus this second wave in which 110,000 cases were reported. “We must analyze that this second wave has now had a higher rate of contagion, much higher than the first wave,” he said. Likewise, he explained that 8,949 deaths were registered in the first wave; while in the second 2,896 deaths were reported. “And this difference is fundamental because the fatality rate has been much lower in this second wave, three times lower, because the fatality rate in the first wave was 6.2 and the fatality rate in this second wave that we are exceeding is 2.6, informed Minister Auza Pinto. In this framework, Auza Pinto highlighted that in the second wave a Strategic Plan to Fight COVID-19 was applied based on three pillars: free and accessible diagnosis, close coordination with subnational governments and the vaccination process. In that direction, the Minister of Health asserted that the country is in a process of de-escalation of cases, without the application of rigid quarantine. Now health officials are asking the public to prepare for a third wave. The Minister of Health and Sports, Jeyson Auza Pinto called on Bolivians to prepare to face a third wave of the pandemic; in addition to maintaining biosecurity measures as a way of protection. “In a short time we are achieving a de-escalation of cases of the second wave (…), but this does not have to give us false optimism, we have to prepare for a third wave,” said the authority in contact with national television media. He stressed that the country cannot “refuse” before the possibility of a new outbreak of the disease because it is a threat that remains latent despite the fact that the Government has been promoting the vaccination process for more than a month. “We cannot make the mistakes (of the past) of improvising at the last moment, we must prepare from today and that is why we are making such an impact on vaccination (…) and I take the opportunity to tell the Bolivian population that despite that we are in a frank de-escalation of cases, it is the moment when we should least let our guard down ”, stressed Minister Auza. The government authority reiterated that it is the moment in which biosecurity measures must continue to be extreme, such as the use of a chinstrap, social distancing, the use of alcohol in the disinfection of surfaces and constant hand washing.",

This brings the country total of MERS cases to seven for 2021. The World Health Organization (WHO) says MERS-CoV  is a virus transferred to humans from infected dromedary camels. It is a zoonotic virus, meaning it is transmitted between animals and people, and it is contractable through direct or indirect contact with infected animals. MERS-CoV has been identified in dromedaries in several countries in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia. In total, 27 countries have reported cases since 2012, leading to 858 known deaths due to the infection and related complications. Human-to-human transmission is possible, but only a few such transmissions have been found among family members living in the same household. In health care settings, however, human-to-human transmission appears to be more frequent.",

        "main_text": "Finland health officials (THL) report the vaccination program against tick-borne encephalitis will be extended to Luoma area in Kirkkonummi and to a part of the Sipoo archipelago. There has been a significant increase in the incidence of the disease in these areas during the five years of monitoring. Permanent and holiday residents over the age of three in the area are entitled to vaccinations under the national vaccination program.  Information on organizing the vaccinations will be communicated separately for each municipality. In addition to the new areas, free TBE vaccinations will continue to be given in the Åland Islands, Pargas, Simo, southern parts of Kemi, the Kotka archipelago, the Sammonlahti district of Lappeenranta, on the island of Preiskari close to Raahe, in the Lohjanjärvi archipelago area and in Kustavi. In 2020, a total of 91 cases of tick-borne encephalitis were reported to THL’s Infectious Diseases Register. The number of reported cases increased slightly compared to previous years. Sixty-nine cases of TBE were reported to the Infectious Diseases Register in 2019, 79 in 2018 and a total of 85 cases in 2017. The TBE vaccine protects only against the tick-borne encephalitis caused by a virus. The vaccine does not protect against other diseases transmitted by ticks, such as Lyme disease, and it does not prevent ticks from attaching to the skin. All diseases spread by ticks can be prevented by protecting oneself against tick bites. “When you spend time in nature in areas where ticks are found, you should use light-coloured clothes with long sleeves and long trousers and tuck the trousers into your socks. An insect repellent that works against ticks gives additional protection,” says Researcher Sari Huusko from THL. “In addition, a tick checks once a day or straight after you have been outdoors in nature and removing ticks as soon as you notice them reduce the risk of Lyme disease,” Huusko continues.

        "main_text": "In a follow-up report on the human infections with the A(H5N8) bird flu virus in Russia last month, Rospotrebnadzor chief, Anna Popova predicts the mutating H5N8 strain of avian flu has a high risk of human-to-human transmission. In an interview with Mikhail Petrov with Russian News Agency TASS (computer translated), Popova was asked: If we continue talking about unpleasant diseases, such a sad discovery this year has already become a case of human infection with bird flu. What does this mean for all of us? Does this threaten a new pandemic? Is it possible later that this virus will begin to spread from person to person? She responded: Mikhail, I disagree with you, this is not a sad case. This is not a sad case, this is a case of a world-class discovery made by Russian scientists, scientists of Vector, who were able to see this transition for the first time in the world before this virus became especially pathogenic for humans and began to be transmitted from person to person. The forecast that this will happen has a fairly high degree of probability. This will most likely happen. Colleagues say that here is the zone where this mutation occurs is very mobile, and the mutation continues there. But we saw it before the disaster struck. We have time to prepare: make a test system, make a vaccine and observe the situation. It will not be needed – this will be a lucky break. But if need be, we’ll be ready. That is, we were able to see and warn the entire world community that that there is a threat. Not when it was already realized, as was the case with the Spanish flu of 1918, the Hong Kong flu of 1969. But mutations in the virus were described back in 1963, 1965, about what is changing there, what will be worse. But nevertheless, by 1969, humanity did not have time to prepare. It’s the same with the highly pathogenic flu, the 2009 swine flu. We saw a little earlier, but measures began to be taken only when people became seriously ill. In this case, everything is completely different: we saw what could change, and with extremely serious consequences for humanity, and we warned about this in time. I think that here is a great scientific result and the result of the whole system. Because in order to obtain such a result, it was necessary to monitor closely, which we did with the “Vector” center, an institute of the Rospotrebnadzor system. We did it all over the country. We have 100 observation laboratories in the country. Therefore, this is a logical result, and it is very important.

For Arieli Fialho, immunization manager of the Epidemiological Surveillance Directorate (DIVE / SC), the disease scenario reinforces the importance of vaccination. “Yellow fever is a serious disease that can lead to death if it is not diagnosed and treated quickly. The vaccine is the best way to prevent the disease. The dose is free and available at health centers ”, he warns. The vaccination coverage of SC for yellow fever is 76%, however, it is heterogeneous, that is, some regions of the state have indices below. “Especially in the places where we have the record of new epidemics, it is necessary that the population is vaccinated. In Greater Florianópolis and Serra we have the lowest coverage ”, highlights João Augusto Brancher Fuck, director of DIVE / SC. All residents of Santa Catarina older than nine months should receive the dose. Those who are not sure if they have already had the vaccine, should look for a health unit to check the vaccination booklet. Yellow fever Yellow fever is a serious disease transmitted by forest mosquitoes (Haemagogus and Sabethes). Monkeys, because they live in the same environment as these animals, are the first victims of the disease. “That is why it is so important that the population communicates to health agencies as soon as they find a dead or sick monkey. They signal the region where the virus is circulating ”, explains Renata Gatti, coordinating biologist for the Yellow Fever Surveillance program in the state of Santa Catarina. The main symptoms of the disease are: abrupt onset of fever, chills, severe headache, back and body pain, nausea and vomiting, weakness and tiredness, abdominal pain and jaundice (yellowish skin). When presenting any signs or symptoms, it is important to seek medical attention.

        "main_text": "The Malaysia Ministry of Health (MOH) has reported two additional confirmed cases of rabies among humans in Sarawak. Both the patients died. The first case of rabies was a 52 -year -old Malaysian man. He denied having a history of being bitten or scratched by dogs or other mammals. However, he once arrested and killed a pet dog in the area of ​​his factory worker’s house on 17 October 2020 after the dog bit two (2) workers there. However, the carcass of the dog was not handed over to the Sarawak Veterinary Services Department (DVS) for further investigation. On 31 January 2021, he was treated and admitted to a ward at Sibu Hospital for chest pain, numbness in his right hand, vomiting and shortness of breath. His health condition deteriorated to the point of requiring respiratory assistance on 5 February 2021. The deceased passed away on 8 February 2021 with the cause of death being due to rabies infection. The deceased’s diagnosis was confirmed positive for rabies through a laboratory test conducted by Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) on February 6, 2021. Meanwhile, two workers who were bitten by the dog have received initial treatment and are still under follow -up monitoring by the health authorities. The second case was a 54 -year -old Malaysian man. On 5 March 2021, he was referred to Sarawak General Hospital (HUS) with symptoms of weakness in the legs, pain throughout the body, fever, nausea and loss of appetite. His health condition deteriorated to the point of needing a respirator on March 7, 2021. Based on the history given, he was once bitten by his pet dog on December 26, 2020 on the right chest while handling the dog. On the same day, this dog was taken by the Local Authority (PBT) for eradication but no samples for rabies test were taken. The victim also never sought treatment after being bitten by her pet dog. The result of Rabies PCR test on his saliva (saliva) sample which was conducted at UNIMAS on 7 March 2021 was positive. The deceased passed away at HUS on 7 March 2021 with the cause of death being due to rabies infection. These two cases are the first two positive cases of rabies among humans in Malaysia for 2021. The addition of these two (2) new cases makes the total number of cases since the rabies outbreak was declared in Sarawak on 1 July 2017 is 33 cases with 31 deaths. There were only two (2) surviving cases and both were children with a history of early treatment.",

Elsewhere in the Americas, the only other country to report confirmed measles cases in French Guiana (2), but currently, only Brazil is reporting active outbreaks of measles–in Amapá, Pará and São Paulo states. Measles is a very contagious disease caused by a virus. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. In fact, the measles virus can stay in the air for up to two hours after an infected person was there. People may be infected by simply being in a room where an infected person once was. It is so contagious that if one person has it, up to 90% of the people around him or her will also become infected if they are not protected.

According to the Fiji Health Ministry, 160 leptospirosis cases, including at least 10 deaths have been recorded. The Fiji Ministry of Health is working to manage the situation, increasing disease surveillance and conducting clean-up and awareness campaigns. Federal health officials say travelers at highest risk for infection are those exposed to contaminated fresh water (such as lakes and rivers in affected areas) while swimming, wading, kayaking, or rafting. Leptospirosis is also a potential hazard for adventure travelers; travelers who spend time around animals, such as veterinarians and animal caretakers; agricultural workers; and humanitarian aid workers. The risk of leptospirosis increases after heavy rainfall and flooding. CDC recommends the following to prevent leptospirosis: Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease. People (and animals) can get infected when they are exposed to the urine of infected animals. They can also get infected from water, soil, or food contaminated with infected animal urine. Leptospirosis bacteria can enter the body through skin or mucous membranes (eyes, nose, or mouth). Symptoms include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, jaundice (yellow eyes and skin), red eyes, and skin rash. Without treatment, leptospirosis can lead to kidney damage, meningitis (inflammation of the membrane around the brain and spinal cord), liver failure, respiratory distress, and even death. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"7f9647e8b904924324a7f245b338852e\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"3662450585,B07TWPD3HQ,B07TN3XX4B,B01CKGQMR6\";",

        "main_text": "Philippines health officials reported today the detection of 52 additional B.1.351 variant (South Africa variant) cases, 31 additional B.1.1.7 variant (UK variant) cases, and 42 additional cases with mutations of potential clinical significance. This run of 350 samples sequenced by the UP-Philippine Genome Center, came from NCR, Region 7, and Returning Overseas Filipinos (ROFs) in response to the increased number of cases in these areas. On Thursday, more than 480,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines arrived in Manila, Philippines from the COVAX Facility, the international partnership established to ensure equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines around the world. The Philippines is among the first countries in Southeast Asia to receive vaccines from the COVAX Facility. “The long days and nights of waiting are finally over. These vaccines will be of great help to our valiant healthcare workers who have been at the forefront of the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. With every dose that we will administer, we are inching towards a safer recovery from this pandemic. So, let us put our trust in science, in vaccines. Together, we will rise as a nation and heal as one,” says Department of Health Secretary Francisco T. Duque III. Outbreak News Interviews podcast on Spotify “WHO joins partners and the people of the Philippines in welcoming the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX Facility. These vaccines coming through COVAX will help protect up to 20% of the population in the country during this year, including healthcare workers, other frontline workers and the elderly – groups who are most at risk. The COVID-19 vaccines are proven to protect people from severe disease and death. Used together with public health measures currently in place – wearing masks, physical distancing, avoiding large groups, and washing hands frequently – will help mitigate the effects of the pandemic by reducing deaths and severe disease. We all welcome the addition of vaccines to the available tools in the country which, when used to scale, will contribute to gradual return of day-to-day activities and economic revival in the country. The delivery of COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines is a powerful step in that direction,” said Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe, WHO Representative to the Philippines. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"7f9647e8b904924324a7f245b338852e\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07TWPD3HQ,B07TN3XX4B,B01CKGQMR6,B07XFG473B\";",

        "main_text": "A patient in Karachi has been diagnosed with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), according to a report in The Nation. “A patient infected with CCHF has been admitted at the Jinnah Hospital,” Dr. Seemi Jamali said. It is the first patient of the Congo virus reported this year. “The patient has been a cowherd and resident of Bilawal Chowrangi in Karachi,” Dr. Jamali said. After confirmation, an alert was issued by the KMC to hospitals, directing them to adopt special precautions for a Congo affected patient. It had further asked hospitals to establish special wards for Congo patients, and run awareness campaigns about the virus. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus ( Nairovirus ) of the Bunyaviridae family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10–40%. Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus Hyalomma are the principal vector. The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission is possible.

DNA vaccine candidate for Lassa fever: First subject dosed in Phase 1B Clinical Trial Lassa Fever is an acute viral illness and a viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF). The causative agent is a single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus in the family arenaviridae , the Lassa virus. This zoonotic disease is associated with high morbidity and mortality, transmitted by the multi-mammate rat ( mastomys natalensis ), one of the most common rats in equatorial Africa. The disease was first discovered in a town called Lassa in Borno State, Nigeria in 1969. The actual incidence rate in Nigeria is unknown, but case fatality rates range from 3% to 42% (and over the last two years has remained between 20% and 25%). Historically, outbreaks occur during the dry season (November to April); however, in recent years, cases have also occurred during the rainy season.

Between 1990 and 2010, the number of malaria cases declined from more than 9000 to 26. The country has reported zero indigenous cases of the disease since 2017. Certification of malaria elimination is granted by WHO when a country has proven, beyond reasonable doubt, that the chain of indigenous transmission has been interrupted nationwide for at least the previous three consecutive years. “For decades, El Salvador has worked hard to wipe out malaria and the human suffering that it generates,” said Dr. Carissa F. Etienne, Director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), WHO’s regional office for the Americas. “Over the years, El Salvador has dedicated both the human and financial resources needed to succeed. This certification today is a life-saving achievement for the Americas.” El Salvador is the third country to have achieved malaria-free status in recent years in the WHO Region of the Americas, following Argentina in 2019 and Paraguay in 2018. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"52bd1b619c90a67fb69462942e098986\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"0312573014,B00INIJLS8,1524743429,0786886676\";",

Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) has long been among the busiest travel hubs in the U.S., ranking No. 2 in total passengers boarded in 2019, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. While air traffic across the U.S. has plummeted in the last year during the pandemic, about 2 million domestic and international passengers still traveled through LAX each month in November and December, 2020. LAX is a key U.S. gateway for a number of the foreign destinations, including Australia, and New Zealand, where CAL.20C now is found. Several Western states that have the strain, including Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico, are popular vacation destinations for Southern Californians. It is not clear whether CAL.20C might be more deadly than current coronavirus strains, or whether it might resist current vaccines. Cedars-Sinai investigators are conducting new, collaborative research to find the answers. CAL.20C is defined by five recurring variants in the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, including the L452R variant that was earlier reported by the California Department of Public Health. It is distinct from other strains present in the U.S., including the United Kingdom’s B.1.1.7 and South Africa’s B.1.351. “New variants do not always affect the behavior of a virus in the body. But we are interested in the CAL.20C strain because three of its five variants involve the so-called spike protein, which enables the SARS-CoV-2 virus to invade and infect normal cells,” said the JAMA study’s other co-senior author, Eric Vail, MD, assistant professor of Pathology and director of Molecular Pathology in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Cedars-Sinai. Although the pace of new coronavirus cases has slowed recently, Los Angeles County remains one of the nation’s pandemic hotspots. Through Feb. 9, the county had reported more than 1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 18,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Cedars-Sinai investigators are tracking the rise and spread of CAL.20C using an advanced technique known as next-generation sequencing to analyze the genes of the viruses. Their research draws on virus samples collected from Cedars-Sinai patients who tested positive for coronavirus, along with analysis of random samples of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in publicly available databases – to which Cedars-Sinai also contributes. The JAMA study’s other co-authors, all from Cedars-Sinai, include first author Wenjuan Zhang, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine; Brian Davis, BS, and Stephanie Chen, BS, both from the Center for Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics; and Jorge Sincuir Martinez from the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. “This study is the latest Cedars-Sinai initiative to contribute a major finding to the international effort to address the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Jeffrey A. Golden, MD, vice dean of Research and Graduate Education and director of the Burns and Allen Research Institute at Cedars-Sinai. “Among other accomplishments, our research teams have shown how the SARS-CoV-2 virus can directly attack the heart. They have uncovered immune dysfunction in coronavirus patients who develop respiratory failure and co-authored high-profile papers reporting results of nationwide clinical trials involving remdesivir and antibody treatments for COVID-19.” The Robert Herriman Show",

        "main_text": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued travel notices for the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Guinea due to ongoing Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreaks. The outbreak, the 12th ever in the DRC is in the North Kivu (Kivu Nord) province in the eastern part of the country–the same location as the 10th outbreak in DRC that began in August 2018 and was declared over in June 2020. To date, eight confirmed cases, including four deaths have been recorded in the outbreak declared on February 7. In Guinea, there is an outbreak of Ebola in the rural community of Gouéké, N’Zérékoré Prefecture of Guinea. This was declared on Feb. 14. To date, nine total cases (5 confirmed and 4 probable), including 5 deaths have been reported. The World Health Organization (WHO) is working with local health authorities to identify sources of transmission, conduct case investigation and case finding, strengthen local laboratory capacity, and to provide Ebola vaccine. The CDC advise travelers to these areas, while the risk is low, could be infected with Ebola if they come in contact with an infected person’s blood or other body fluids.

On Friday, the CDC said in a statement air travel has the potential to transport people, some of whom may have been exposed to a communicable disease, anywhere across the globe in less than 24 hours. Therefore, out of an abundance of caution, the U.S. government will institute public health measures for the very small number of travelers arriving from the DRC and Guinea. Beginning next week, the U.S. government will funnel travelers from DRC and Guinea to six U.S. airports. Airlines will collect and transmit passenger information to CDC for public health follow-up and intervention for all passengers boarding a flight to the U.S. who were in DRC or Guinea within the previous 21 days. This information will be shared with U.S. state and local health departments to appropriately monitor arrivals in their jurisdiction.

        "main_text": "The South Africa National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) reported the first human rabies case and death of 2021 in a child from KwaZulu-Natal. The case was a 2-year-old boy from eNgonyameni, near uMlazi (south of eThekwini District) in KwaZulu-Natal Province. The child sustained an injury on his head while playing with a dog in the last week of January 2021. The boy was taken to hospital, but reportedly no rabies PEP was administered. Purportedly, the dog died. The boy was admitted to a hospital on 10 February with fever, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, muscle spasm, hypersalivation, hydrophobia, confusion, agitation, hyperactivity and aggressive behavior, and died the following day. A single saliva sample, collected before the patient died, tested positive on rabies RT–PCR. In 2020, the total number of laboratory confirmed human rabies cases is eight. These cases have been reported from KwaZulu-Natal (n=6) and Limpopo (n=2) provinces, including a 9-year-old boy who acquired the infection in December 2020, but died in 2021. In South Africa, the majority of cases of human rabies are linked to dog bites, so controlling the disease in these animals prevents the spread of the disease to humans. The COVID-19 epidemic in South Africa has affected the control and prevention of rabies.

        "main_text": "CDC and public health officials in several states are investigating a multistate outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium infections linked to small turtles. As of February 20, 2021, a total of 22 people infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Typhimurium have been reported from seven states–Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Maryland, New Jersey, California, Florida and Connecticut. Pennsylvania has reported the most cases with 9. Of the nine laboratory-confirmed S almonella Typhimurium illnesses. Eight of the cases have occurred in people living in Philadelphia or Delaware counties. Seven of the cases have occurred among children, ranging between 0 to 10 years old. One adult death has occurred in which salmonellosis was one of the contributing factors. “While we continue to work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as part of this investigation, the cause of these serious Salmonella cases has been linked to small pet turtles,” Acting Secretary of Health Alison Beam said. “The majority of the cases have occurred in children living in the southeastern part of the state.  This is concerning, as Salmonella can be particularly serious for children. Anyone who has purchased a small pet turtle and became ill should contact their health care provider, their local health department or the Department of Health at 1-877-PA-HEALTH ( 1-877-724-3258 ).” CDC says a common supplier of small turtles has not yet been identified. It is often difficult to determine a common farm or supplier of small turtles due to the illegal practice of sales of small turtles by mobile vendors who do not stay in a single location. Salmonellosis is a serious infection of the gastrointestinal tract. Diarrhea is the most common symptom, but other symptoms may include fever, headache, nausea and vomiting. In addition, salmonellosis can cause severe illness (e.g., bloodstream infection, bone and joint infection, meningitis) and can be particularly serious for young children, the elderly, and persons with weak immune systems.

Positive clinical specimens were collected from poultry farm workers who participated in a response operation to contain an avian influenza A(H5N8) outbreak detected in a poultry farm in Astrakhan Oblast in the Russian Federation. The cases remained asymptomatic for the whole follow up duration (several weeks). Follow-up nasopharyngeal swabs were collected during medical observation period and were tested negative for avian influenza A(H5N8). No obvious clinical manifestations were reported from any farm workers under medical surveillance, their family members, or other close contacts of the seven cases. Additionally, acute and convalescent sera was collected from the seven positive human cases for serological testing. The results were suggestive of recent infection. Between 3 and 11 December, a total of 101,000 of 900,000 egg laying hens on the farm died. This high mortality rate prompted an investigation. Samples were collected from these birds and an initial detection of avian influenza A(H5N8) was performed by the Russian regional veterinary laboratory. Influenza A(H5N8) viruses isolated from this poultry outbreak in Astrakhan belonged to clade 2.3.4.4b of avian influenza A(H5Nx) viruses. In 2020, avian influenza A (H5N8) viruses were also detected in poultry or wild birds in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Germany, Hungary, Iraq, Japan, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, the United Kingdom, and the Russian Federation. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"9a45f5af7230a32831e208b19113f87e\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07N9LDMF8,B073KTXFLS,B07W7SZJ25,B07WWSSCZ7\";",

        "main_text": "In a follow-up report at the beginning of the year , health officials in the Ituri province region in the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are reporting some 520 plague cases during the past three months, including 31 deaths, according to an AFP report . According to the health minister for the region, Patrick Karamura, the vast majority of the cases are the bubonic form of the disease, while five cases of pneumonic plague and two of septicemic plague have also been reported. In addition, local media report (computer translated) cases of bubonic plague are reported in some health zones of the territories of Djugu, Mahagi and Aru in Ituri province. Doctor Jean-Jacques Muyembe, who made a stopover this Tuesday, February 16, 2021 in Bunia, announced the arrival of a specialized team to confirm the presence of the epidemic. “So far the disease is there but we have not confirmed. I want to send a team of specialists who will come here with the machines to confirm this epidemic. I think that from next week the team will be here and will work with you at the provincial laboratory level ,” he said. Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium, Yersinia pestis . It is found in animals throughout the world, most commonly rats but other rodents like ground squirrels, prairie dogs, chipmunks, rabbits and marmots in China. Fleas typically serve as the vector for plague. People can also get infected through direct contact with an infected animal, through inhalation and in the case of pneumonic plague, person to person. Yersinia pestis is treatable with antibiotics if started early enough. There are three forms of human plague; bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"c59f517b99e8758bb2ac527525ddca63\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"1510713948,B01M301Q1C,0199937982,0060006935\"; Robert Koch Quote",

The workers did not suffer any serious health consequences, she added. “Information about the world’s first case of transmission of the avian flu (H5N8) to humans has already been sent to the World Health Organization,”, Popova said. “The Vector Center of the Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing has already added to the international GISAID database the data of a whole genome sequencing of the А(H5N8) virus with those mutations that allowed it to cross the interspecies barrier,” she added. “So far we can see that the novel agent of the A(H5N8) bird flu is capable of transmission from birds to humans – it crossed the interspecies barrier.

The upsurge in the epidemic curve of Covid-19 in Amazonas, registered in early January this year by the Health authorities, is beginning to show signs of remission. In the last two weeks, the state had a drop of 31% in the registration of new cases of the disease and of 43% in the number of deaths. Manaus continues to be the epicenter of the pandemic in the state, and has lower rates of reduction in new cases (30%) and deaths (41%). The interior has the best results, with a 33% drop in new cases and 57% in the number of deaths. The interior has a lethality rate of 1.8, lower than the Brazilian average, which is 2.4. Amazonas has already vaccinated 208,040 people in the first phase of immunization against Covid-19, equivalent to 63.6% of the total programmed for this stage. Manaus, with more than 110 thousand vaccinated, reaches 82.7% of the target, pulling Amazonas to the first position on the immunization map in the whole country. For the second dose, 16.7 thousand people have already been vaccinated across the state, equivalent to 5% of the target. The state is preparing to start, next week, a task force that aims to vaccinate the entire population up to the age of 50. The vaccines for this will come from the two lots that will be made available by the Butantan and Fiocruz laboratories. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"c2c74bc1ed6adc314e0a42b49bcc5c83\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B08FBK2DK5,B08R81R628,B08WLK7ZKD,B08V8PWTMG\"; Paraguay reports 700 dengue cases a week early in 2021 Diphtheria: Dominican Republic reports 3 unrelated cases, No outbreak Chile: More than 1.7 million adults over 65 have been vaccinated against COVID-19 Hantavirus: Argentina reports 5 cases in Salta since beginning of 2021 Candida auris in the Americas during the COVID-19 pandemic Yellow fever: Three more monkey deaths in Paraná",

The sequencing, involving a Nassau County resident, was conducted at Opentrons Labworks Inc’s Pandemic Response Lab, a New York City based commercial lab, and verified at the Wadsworth Center in Albany. Last week, a Connecticut resident who had been hospitalized in New York City was found to have the South African variant. Cuomo also announced that for the first time since late November, the state’s COVID-19 positivity rate dropped below 3 percent–now at 2.99 percent. “We continue to see a reduction in positivity and hospitalizations throughout the state, which is good news, and this progress is allowing us to reopen the valve on our economy even further,” Governor Cuomo said. “But with the discovery of a case of the South African variant in the state, it’s more important than ever for New Yorkers to stay vigilant, wear masks, wash hands and stay socially distanced. We are in a race right now — between our ability to vaccinate and these variants which are actively trying to proliferate — and we will only win that race if we stay smart and disciplined.” To date, New York has seen about 1.6 million COVID-19 cases, including 46,812 deaths.

Communes reporting the most cases to date include Ponérihouen with 11, and six each in Païta and Poindimié. Leptospirosis is caused by a corkscrew-shaped bacterium called Leptospira , is often referred to as “rat fever” due to the principal role rats play in spreading the disease (scientists refer this type of animal as a reservoir host).  Other animals can also be important reservoirs of the disease. These animals can spread the disease in their urine, contaminating water, soil, or food.  People who live in close contact with domestic animals or wildlife are at higher risk for getting the disease. People become infected by coming into contact with contaminated urine, water, food, or soil through breaks in the skin, eyes, mouth, or nose. Outbreaks of leptospirosis are usually caused by exposure to contaminated water, such as floodwaters . Person to person transmission is rare. Infected individuals initially experience fever, severe headache and muscle aches, abdominal pain, and occasionally a skin rash. Patients in the later stages of disease can suffer from jaundice, kidney failure, bleeding from the mouth or nose, bloody urine and can be fatal, especially without proper treatment.",

Five deaths have been reported in N’Zerekore. In addition, over 2,000 miles away in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), four cases and two deaths have been reported in North Kivu province. Today, the White House released a statement on the Ebola outbreaks in Africa: Infectious diseases are transnational health and national security threats. While the world is reeling from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Ebola has again emerged, simultaneously, in both Central and West Africa.  The world cannot afford to turn the other way.  We must do everything in our power to respond quickly, effectively, and with commensurate resources to stop these outbreaks before they become largescale epidemics. President Biden has been briefed on the situation in both Central and West Africa, and his prayers are with the families of those who have died and those who are impacted by Ebola, COVID-19, and other ongoing global health challenges. The Biden Administration will do everything in its power to provide U.S. leadership to stop these outbreaks, working with the affected governments, the World Health Organization, the African Union and the African Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, and neighboring states. On February 16, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke with the Ambassadors of Guinea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, and Liberia to the United States to convey the United States willingness to work closely with the governments of affected countries, and neighboring countries whose citizens would be at risk of the current outbreak spread.  Mr. Sullivan emphasized President Biden’s commitment to provide U.S. leadership to strengthen health security and create better systems for preventing, detecting, and responding to health emergencies. Outbreaks require swift and overwhelming response in order to avoid catastrophic consequences.  Since the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, the United States has endeavored to elevate and prioritize health security assistance with partners through the Global Health Security Agenda and with strong support from Congress. We cannot afford to take our foot off the gas – even as we battle COVID, we must ensure capacity and financing for health security worldwide.  President Biden’s first National Security Memorandum directed that U.S. leadership in health security and global health be elevated, prioritized, and strengthened. The United States stands ready to do everything in its power to ensure a robust global response and to stop these outbreaks. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"1c2504fd7c78235b330bd44f313e025e\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B085XQJXW7,B08KBCVVND\";",

Genetic sequencing completed at the Broad Institute on behalf of DPH has confirmed the variant, which was originally identified in South Africa. The case is a female in her 20s who resides in Middlesex County; she has had no reported travel. The B.1.351 variant is known to spread easily. The Massachusetts State Public Health Laboratory is working in collaboration with many healthcare and academic partners to quickly identify variants of concern by sequencing a subset of positive samples. Two other variants of concern are the B.1.1.7 originally found in the United Kingdom, and the P.1 variant, which was originally detected in Brazil.  Currently, there are 34 cases of the B.1.1.7 variant in Massachusetts; there are no confirmed cases of the P.1. The best defense against a rapid rise in cases from variants of concern is to prevent the spread of COVID. The CDC reported yesterday that 1277 United Kingdom (UK) variant B.1.1.7 cases in 42 states, 19 of the South African strain in 10 states and 3 of the P.1 Brazil variant in 2 states. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"57ac849d03b7c3fcf5b603831b5fd0b3\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B08BS5LW7X,B08FPXPGJW,B088X29HF6,B088X2YR3X\";",

        "main_text": "A 34-year-old Khairpur man is the first reported case of rabies in Sindh, according to a SAMAA report . The man was reportedly  bitten on the foot by a stray dog three months ago. He did not receive complete treatment at the time which could have prevented rabies. He is now admitted in the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for comfort care, said JPMC Executive Director Dr Seemin Jamali. The patient wasn’t given anti-rabies immunoglobulin, she said. He is in a critical state. Rabies is an acute viral infection that is transmitted to humans or other mammals usually through the saliva from a bite of an infected animal. It is also rarely contracted through breaks in the skin or contact with mucous membranes. Initially, like in many diseases, the symptoms are non-specific; fever, headache and malaise. This may last several days. At the site of the bite there may be some pain and discomfort. Symptoms then progress to more severe: confusion, delirium, abnormal behavior and hallucinations. If it gets this far, the disease is nearly 100% fatal. There were 205,319 cases of dog bite reported last year in Sindh. At least 19 people died after contracting the disease.

Twelve cases of Salmonella Enteritidis disease have been linked using whole genome sequencing (analysis of the bacterium’s genome). Eight of the twelve patients are children under the age of ten and the cases are resident in ten different regions. All cases except one have fallen ill on January 20 or later. There are as many women / girls as men / boys who that have fallen ill. The affected infection control units and the Swedish Public Health Agency are jointly investigating the outbreak to identify the source of the infection. In Sweden, less than one percent of all food-producing animals and foods are infected with salmonella, unlike most other countries in Europe, where it is common for, for example, raw chicken and eggs to be contaminated with salmonella. In most European countries (except Norway, Finland and Sweden) Salmonella Enteritidis from eggs and chicken is a particularly big problem. In 2019, 1993 cases of salmonella infection were reported, corresponding to an incidence of 19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The incidence of domestic cases has been stable over time (7.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 2019), while the incidence of infections outside Sweden continues to decrease. Of those infected abroad (n = 1215), most were infected in Thailand, Turkey, Spain, Egypt and Greece.

        "main_text": "Health authorities in Guinea declared an Ebola outbreak on 14 February after three cases detected in Gouécké, a rural community in N’Zerekore prefecture tested positive for the virus. It is the first Ebola outbreak in Guinea since 2016. As of Feb. 18, Guinea has reported seven cases (3 confirmed and 4 probable) and 5 deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) is deploying teams of experts to support the national authorities ramp up the response and avert widespread infections. More than 100 WHO staff, deployed from other countries and from within Guinea, are expected to be part of the Ebola response by the end of February. Efforts are ongoing to step up surveillance, contact-tracing, testing and treatment as well as preparing for vaccination. “We are hard at work, shifting quickly through the gears to get ahead of the virus. With experts and emergency supplies already getting on the ground, the response is off to a strong start,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “Our collective, quick action is crucial to averting an uncontrolled spread of Ebola amid the COVID-19 pandemic which has already pushed health workers and health facilities to the edge.” A humanitarian flight arrived on 15 February in N’Zerekore with 700 kg of medical equipment donated by WHO and partners. A consignment of more than 11 000 doses of Ebola vaccine is expected to arrive in Guinea this weekend. In addition, more than 8500 doses will be shipped from the United States of America for a total of 20 000 doses. Vaccination is set to kick off shortly afterwards. A 30-strong vaccination team has already been mobilized locally and is ready to deploy as soon as the vaccines are received. With the epicentre of the Ebola outbreak in Guinea being a border area, countries in the sub-region are on high alert and increasing public health measures and surveillance in border towns and communities to quickly detect and respond to possible cross-border infections. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"ea4fc964f280d530bce8fe21e044b5e7\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07PGLBCFG,B01D2UJVGS,B08B5XH1JN,B07N9LDMF8\";",

He specifies that a local association which supplies water to the population is no longer functioning and the population is now using water that is unfit for consumption. Outbreak News Merchandise Cholera is a disease spread by drinking water or eating food contaminated with cholera bacteria. Severe cholera is characterized by large amounts of watery diarrhea, often described as “rice-water stool” because it can have a pale, milky appearance. It can also be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. If untreated, the loss of fluid can be deadly. But simple treatment, including replacing lost body fluids, can lower the risk of death to less than 1%. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"54bc2728aee548d4a79d52305586f834\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B01N6BP63M,B07GBCCJXK,B005BPH40I,B083HL7NMC\"; Ebola outbreak in Guinea: Efforts being ramped up to get ahead of virus Guinea reports 5th Ebola death, Biden Administration statement South Africa authorities warn of rabies risk: ‘A person dying of rabies is an unnecessary death’ Kenya Rift Valley fever outbreak update DRC declares 12th Ebola outbreak Ethiopia: Dengue outbreak in Somali Region",

As of February 18, 2021, there have been 57 laboratory-confirmed cases of Salmonella Enteritidis illness investigated in the following provinces: Newfoundland and Labrador (25), and Nova Scotia (32). Individuals became sick between late October 2020 and late January 2021. Nineteen individuals have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Based on the investigation findings to date, exposure to eggs has been identified as a likely source of the outbreak. Many of the individuals who became sick reported consuming, preparing, cooking and baking at home with eggs. Some individuals reported exposure to eggs at an institution (including nursing homes and hospitals) where they resided or worked before becoming ill. Between October and December 2020, CFIA issued food recall warnings for a variety of eggs distributed in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador. The recalled eggs are now past their shelf-life and are no longer available for purchase. Eggs can sometimes be contaminated with Salmonella bacteria on the shell and inside the egg. The bacteria are most often transmitted to people when they improperly handle, eat or cook contaminated foods. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"ea4fc964f280d530bce8fe21e044b5e7\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07PGLBCFG,B01D2UJVGS,B08B5XH1JN,B07N9LDMF8\";",

The cat, which became ill in early January, has now recovered following veterinary treatment. “ NMDOH staff will conduct an environmental investigation to ensure the safety of the immediate family and neighbors,” said Secretary-Designate Dr. Tracie Collins. “We also offer a friendly reminder: even in the midst of a global pandemic, other diseases still occur in New Mexico, and there are steps people can take to keep themselves and their pets safe.” Plague is a bacterial disease in wildlife and is generally transmitted to pets through the bites of infected fleas or after eating an infected animal. Humans can also contract plague via infected fleas or direct contact with infected animals. Symptoms of plague in humans include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and weakness. In most cases there is a painful swelling of the lymph node in the groin, armpit or neck area. Plague symptoms in cats and dogs are fever, lethargy and loss of appetite; there may be swelling in the lymph nodes under the jaw. With prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment, the probability of death in people and pets can be greatly reduced.

        "main_text": "Guinea In a follow-up on a report yesterday on a possible Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in the west African nation of Guinea, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported today that Guinea health officials declared an outbreak of Ebola in the rural community of Gouéké in N’Zerekore prefecture after three Ebola cases were confirmed by the national laboratory, marking the first time the disease has been reported in the country since an outbreak ended in 2016. Initial investigations found that a nurse from the local health facility died on the 28 January 2021. Following her burial, six people who attended the funeral reported Ebola-like symptoms and two of them have died, while the other four have been hospitalized–so far a total of seven (7) cases (4 men and 3 women) with three (3) deaths (2 women and a man) reported. “It’s a huge concern to see the resurgence of Ebola in Guinea, a country which has already suffered so much from the disease. However, banking on the expertise and experience built during the previous outbreak, health teams in Guinea are on the move to quickly trace the path of the virus and curb further infections,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for Africa. “WHO is supporting the authorities to set up testing, contact-tracing and treatment structures and to bring the overall response to full speed.” On Sunday, Feb. 14, the Minister of Health called for an emergency meeting and put in place a swift emergency response measures, in consultation with different stakeholders, including partners. The public health measures put in place include: activation of different intersectoral coordination and emergency response units; further investigation and contact tracing; isolation of suspected cases; and social mobilization and community engagement. The Government is working on to get EVD vaccines from different parties. During the 2014–2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak, there were 28,000 cases, including 11,000 deaths.  The outbreak started in Guinea and then moved across land borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia. Democratic Republic of the Congo In a follow-up on the EVD outbreak in North Kivu province, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC),  provincial health officials confirmed a fourth case of Ebola in the area in a week. The province of North Kivu was hard hit in the 10th epidemic, which lasted almost two years before being declared over last June, afflicting more than 3,460 people and killing 2,280.

The teams will facilitate community awareness and public health measures to reduce the risk of the spread of Leptospirosis, Typhoid, and Dengue (LTD’s) and will further ensure that community screening remains the priority for early diagnosis and treatment of LTD’s and any other undiagnosed medical problems. The recent natural disasters have escalated the surge in communicable diseases such as LTD’s in various sub-divisions and every effort is made to contain further spread of the diseases. The current trends according to baseline thresholds for each disease indicates that: 1. Leptospirosis is above the expected level for this time of the year throughout the nation, 2. Dengue is below expected levels nationally except in Levuka. There is a risk of a rise in cases, especially in the North, once the rainfall slows down and there is an increase in stagnant water pooling 3. Typhoid is below the expected level- except for some clusters in Wainikoro and Naduri medical areas in the North. The Ministry has recorded 160 Leptospirosis cases nationally with an Incidence Rate of 18.0/100,000 population and 5 confirmed deaths while 335 confirmed Dengue Fever cases with an Incidence Rate of 23.6/100,000 population and 1 confirmed death. Similarly, we have 53 Typhoid cases nationwide with an Incidence Rate of 5.9/100,000 population and 1 confirmed death.

He said, however, that the results of the first tests carried out in local laboratories in the forest region would have confirmed cases of Ebola, a disease manifested by fever, vomiting and diarrhea. “The patients all come from the sub-prefecture of Goueké, located about 45 kilometers from Nzérékoré, but since yesterday we have been monitoring the situation. We have already made all the arrangements even before the samples are sent to the Gueckedou laboratory”, he said. “At the moment, there are three patients who are hospitalized at the CTEPI of Nzérékoré, there have already been three cases of death for the moment “, announced the Minister of Health. The doctor colonel Rémy Lamah specifies that it is necessary to await the results of the second opinion of the samples in the laboratories of Conakry, before making any declaration. The samples taken from the sick have already arrived. ” Before making any statement, we await the results of the second opinion, the samples have already arrived here, ” said the Minister of Health.

A second case and death was reported Thursday in a 60-year-old woman from Ngubi village, three kilometres from the Health centre of Masoya in Butembo. On Friday, a third confirmed case of virus disease Ebola was detected in Katwa near Butembo, according to health officials. On Friday, 1200 doses of Ebola vaccine and cold chain equipment arrived in Butembo, the health ministry and the World Health Organization said in a statement. “An outbreak of such a highly contagious disease, in a region already experiencing mass people movements due to violent spikes of conflict that have recently affected nearly 26,000 families, is worrisome,” says World Vision’s National Director Anne-Marie Connor.

        "main_text": "On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a health advisory over extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Salmonella Typhi (Typhi) infections among U.S. residents without international travel. In 2016, a large outbreak of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Typhi infections began in Sindh province, Pakistan. XDR Typhi strains are resistant to antibiotics generally recommended to treat typhoid fever, including ampicillin, ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Isolates from patients linked to the outbreak in Pakistan are susceptible to carbapenems and azithromycin. Infections among travelers to or from Pakistan have been reported globally, including in the United States. As of January 14, 2021, CDC has received 71 reports of XDR Typhi infection in the United States, with specimens obtained from February 9, 2018, through November 16, 2020. Among 67 patients with known travel history, 58 (87%) had traveled to Pakistan in the 30 days before illness began. Nine (13%) patients from six states (NY [3], CA [2], IL, MD, NJ, and TX) reported that they had not traveled to Pakistan or any other country. Specimens from these nine patients were obtained from November 7, 2019, through October 7, 2020, with eight obtained in 2020. Susceptibility testing of these specimens showed the same resistance pattern described in Pakistan. CDC has not identified linkages among these patients or a common source of infection. Typhoid fever is a systemic illness caused by the bacterium Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (Typhi). Most people in the United States diagnosed with typhoid fever acquired it during international travel, but some acquired it in the United States. The disease is treated with antibiotics; without appropriate antibiotic treatment,12–30% of people with typhoid fever will die. Typhi is transmitted through contaminated food and water and person-to-person contact. CDC recommends vaccination for people traveling to places where typhoid fever is common. Because typhoid fever vaccines are not 100% effective, travelers should always practice safe eating and drinking habits to help prevent infection. In the advisory, CDC also advises health providers on treatment recommendations for XDR Typhi infection.",

        "main_text": "The Scottish government are reminding bird keepers to maximize biosecurity and keep their flocks housed after avian influenza (H5N1) was confirmed in a flock of approximately 14,000 mixed gamebirds on a gamebird rearing premises in Leven, Glenrothes. Laboratory results of samples taken from the flock have identified the strain as highly pathogenic in poultry. In order to limit the further spread of disease, appropriate restrictions have been imposed on the premises. A Protection Zone (PZ) of 3 km and a Surveillance Zone (SZ) of 10 km have now been put in place around the infected premises to limit the risk of spread of the disease. Within these zones a range of controls are in place, including restrictions on the movement of poultry, carcasses, eggs, used poultry litter and manure.  Legislation for the H5N1 strain require a Restricted Zone (RZ) to also be declared.  However, this RZ will also be 10 km and will have the same extent as the PZ and SZ, with no additional measures. Public health advice remains that the risk to human health from the virus is very low and food standards bodies advise that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers, and it does not affect the consumption of poultry products including eggs. Producers and bird keepers are reminded to comply with the order to house birds that came in to effect on the 14 December 2020, or ensure they are kept separate from wild birds and follow biosecurity procedures. Minister for Rural Affairs and the Natural Environment Ben Macpherson said: “Following this confirmation I have put in place controls required under domestic and EU legislation that will help control any further spread of the disease in the surrounding area. We ask that the public remain vigilant and report any findings of dead wild birds. People should not handle the birds. ” Listen to Outbreak News Interviews podcast on Spotify Scotland’s Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: “This highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza (H5N1) has been confirmed on a farm of approximately 14,000 mixed gamebirds with high mortality in the last few days. All remaining birds are being humanely culled for disease control purposes. “It is vital that keepers take steps to improve their biosecurity and protect their birds from disease. Keepers who are concerned about the health or welfare of their flock should seek veterinary advice immediately. Your private vet, or your local Animal and Plant Health Agency office, will also be able to practical provide advice on keeping your birds safe from infection.” amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"1c2504fd7c78235b330bd44f313e025e\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07SBTJLTJ,B07K9F7XYC\"; Scotland confirms H5N8 avian influenza on Island of Sanday farm Scotland: Two diphtheria cases reported in Edinburgh Scotland reports 100 percent increase in gonorrhea in 5 years Scotland: Several wound botulism cases reported since February Mad Cow disease case reported in Scotland",

        "main_text": "COVID-19 Of the total accumulated positive cases of COVID-19 in Metropolitan Lima (480,438), the jurisdiction of South Lima represents 46.6% (223,972) so far in the pandemic, reported the Directorate of Integrated Health Networks (Diris) South Lima of the Ministry of Health (Minsa). The executive director of Health Monitoring and Management of the Diris Lima Sur, Oscar Manuel Espejo Fernández, explained that, according to what was reported in the COVID-19 Situation Room of the Diris Lima Sur, as of February 3 of this year, 86.1% of active cases are found in 5 of the 13 districts of this jurisdiction, being Santiago de Surco (994), Villa El Salvador (818), San Juan de Miraflores (744), Villa María del Triunfo (713) and Chorrillos (688) the districts where the increase has been observed since the beginning of January. Additionally, the specialist pointed out that the number of confirmed cases of this disease compared to the total population shows infections in younger people and adults, while in relation to the fatality rate, the elderly are the most affected, where 1 in 7 die. In this sense, Diris Lima Sur reported that a series of actions are being carried out that promote the reactivation of the first level of care and the strengthening of community action, especially in the areas most affected by the disease. “We urge the population to reinforce preventive and protective actions to contain the rapid spread of the virus, through frequent hand washing, correct use of the mask, respect for physical distance of at least one and a half meters, as well as leave home only for what is strictly necessary, “he concluded. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"645c4df265005fc43ef98a9a64446460\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"0714869201,1786573822\"; Canine rabies The Departmental Veterinary Medical College of Lima warned that there is a risk that canine rabies could be reintroduced in the capital. This situation could be due to the “weakness” of the epidemiological surveillance system in the capital, a vital tool to identify the increase in cases. Last year, in Lima only 11 samples were received and processed for the diagnosis of rabies, when in the capital there are about two million dogs. “(…) There should be an approximate of four thousand annual samples as epidemiological surveillance, considering the recommendations of the Pan American Health Organization and the current regulations on rabies surveillance in the country,” warns the aforementioned union through of a statement. This situation is complicated if we take into account that in 2020 the Ministry of Health detected 24 cases of canine rabies in the country, of which 20 corresponded to Arequipa and four to Puno. Meanwhile, in January of this year alone, 10 cases of rabies were reported in Arequipa. “This highlights the high risk of presenting cases of human rabies in Arequipa and canine rabies in other cities of the country, as well as in Lima,” he said. For this reason, he recommended that veterinarians from the private sector send samples to a nearby health facility or to the Zoonosis Control Health Center (formerly the Anti-Rabies Center), located in Cercado de Lima. “All colleagues from private clinics, as well as the Comprehensive Health Directorates (Diris) of Lima, are urged to carry out the important work of epidemiological surveillance by reporting and sending samples of dead animals with nervous symptoms compatible with rabies or deaths from being run over”, according to the alert.

In December 2020, Brazil officials reported the first C. auris isolate in the country, in a healthcare facility in the state of Bahia. The isolate was recovered from the catheter tip of a hospitalized intensive care unit (ICU) patient with complications from COVID-19. Before the end of the year, two other cases had been confirmed in hospitalized patients (one positive for C. auris on the catheter tip and the other positive for C. auris in blood culture). The outbreak investigation subsequently found extensive colonization of patients and environmental contamination by C. auris. Also in December, Guatemala reported a case d in soft tissue and bone biopsies from a patient diagnosed with acute osteomyelitis of the right tibia. In addition, a second case, from the same general surgery service, was recovered from a leg tissue biopsy of a multiple trauma patient with a surgical site infection. Mexico reported its first C. auris case in May last year in the state of Nuevo León, in the blood cultures of a non-COVID patient with severe endometriosis. Three months later, while the hospital was transitioning from general care to exclusively caring for COVID-19 patients, 34 colonizations and an outbreak of C. auris were identified, involving 10 ICU patients. These isolates were obtained from the bloodstream and urine. All infected patients had a history of COVID-19 pneumonia, ICU hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, urinary catheter, central venous catheter, prolonged stay, and antibiotic therapy. In late 2020, Peru reported the confirmation of C. auris in two patients at a public hospital in Lima, both with respiratory ailments (latent tuberculosis in the first and COVID-19 in the second). In Panama, since the beginning of the pandemic, 124 C. auris isolates have been identified, of which 108 correspond to patients diagnosed with COVID-19. In Colombia, during the year 2020, 585 cases of C. auris were reported, of which 37 occurred in patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infections. In the United States, in July 2020, the Health Department of the State of Florida, United States, was alerted to a C. auris outbreak that involved three bloodstream infections and one urinary tract infection, in four hospitalized COVID-19 patients. An investigation was then carried out to identify colonized patients. Of the 67 patients admitted to the COVID-19 unit and tested, 35 (52%) had positive cultures. The average age of the colonized patients was 69 years (range = 38-101 years) and 60% were male. Six (17%) colonized patients subsequently developed C. auris infection. The appearance and subsequent worldwide spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has presented a great challenge for health systems, overloading their capacity. Intensive care unit, with patients who have the greatest risk factors for C. auris infection, have been the most affected.",

Ebola virus was confirmed in samples taken from a patient with Ebola-like symptoms who had sought treatment at a local health centre. The woman was the wife of an Ebola survivor. She has since died. The World Health Organization (WHO) says Butembo was one of the epicentres of the previous Ebola outbreak in eastern DRC. It is not unusual for sporadic cases to occur following a major outbreak. WHO epidemiologists are on the ground investigating the case. Already more than 70 contacts have been identified. Disinfection of sites visited by patient is also ongoing. The DRC’s 10 th Ebola outbreak which lasted for nearly two years was the second largest in the world and by the time it ended there were 3481 cases, 2299 deaths and 1162 survivors. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"d613750342c67da5753fdb06874becd8\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B00O3GS0FE,0374234329,1640121420,0140250913\"; Ebola outbreak declared over: The end of the 11th DRC outbreak FDA approves Ebanga for the treatment of Ebola Ethiopia: Dengue outbreak in Somali Region Measles resurfaces in northern DRC Liberia: Polio outbreak declared as National Public Health Emergency Monkeypox returns to the Central African Republic South Africa reports another human rabies death",

        "main_text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) in the Western Pacific Region announced recently two additional human avian influenza A(H5N6) virus infections in China. The first case is a three-year-old female from Guizhou Province, China who was admitted to hospital with severe illness and died on 22 December 2020. The second case is a one-year-old female from Anhui Province, China who developed mild illness in December 2020. Both cases were sporadic and had exposure to poultry at markets prior to onset of illness. To date, a total of 29 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N6) virus including nine deaths have been reported to WHO from China since 2014. Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans includes eye infection (conjunctivitis), flu-like symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) or severe respiratory illness (e.g. chest infection). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days. Outbreak News Interviews: The Top 10 podcasts of 2020 The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and even death. People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient. People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. The elderly, children and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.",

        "main_text": "In late January 2021, anthrax was detected in an unvaccinated mob of ewes and lambs on a Central West NSW property with a previous history of anthrax. The affected animals were ewes which had not been vaccinated for anthrax and biosecurity measures at the affected property, including stock movement restrictions and the vaccination of remaining livestock were immediately imposed. NSW DPI senior veterinary officer, Graham Bailey said while there are no general public health risks or trade implications from the detection, it served as a timely reminder. “Cases of anthrax in NSW tend to occur in an area which runs through the centre of the state, between Bourke and Moree in the north, to Albury and Deniliquin in the south,” Dr Bailey said. “Anthrax can be prevented by annual vaccination of cattle and sheep. Producers in high-risk locations are encouraged to consider vaccination.” “Ingestion of soil by sheep, cattle and other ruminants is one of the key risk factors for anthrax,” Other risk factors include a history of anthrax on the property, grazing stubble or very short pastures, low ground cover, deep cultivation or earthworks in paddocks, soil movement or exposure as a result of rain, contact with infected carcasses and alkaline soils which favour spore survival. LLS Animal Biosecurity and Welfare business partner, Scott Ison, said farmers can apply to use the anthrax vaccine through their LLS district veterinarian. “Once authorised, applicants can place an order for the vaccine with their local rural supplier or private veterinarian,” Dr Ison said.",

        "main_text": "“We can now say definitively that COVID-19 is much more severe than seasonal influenza,” says Dr. Amol Verma, St. Michael’s Hospital, Unity Health Toronto, and the University of Toronto. “Patients admitted to hospital in Ontario with COVID-19 had a 3.5 times greater risk of death, 1.5 times greater use of the ICU, and 1.5 times longer hospital stays than patients admitted with influenza.” These findings are similar to study results recently reported in France and the United States. The study compared hospitalizations for influenza between November 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020, in 7 large hospitals in Toronto and Mississauga — areas with large populations and high levels of COVID-19. It included all patients admitted to medical services or the intensive care unit (ICU) for influenza or COVID-19. There were 783 hospitalizations for influenza in 763 unique patients compared with 1027 hospitalizations for COVID-19 in 972 unique patients (representing 23.5% of all hospitalizations for COVID-19 in Ontario during the study period). Most patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had few other illnesses, and 21% were younger than 50 years of age. People younger than 50 also accounted for almost 1 in 4 (24%) admissions to the ICU. “Many people believe that COVID-19 mainly affects older people,” says Dr. Verma. “It is true that COVID-19 affects older adults most severely. We found that among adults over 75 years who were hospitalized with COVID-19, nearly 40% died in hospital. But it can also cause very serious illness in younger adults. Adults under 50 accounted for 20% of all COVID-19 hospitalizations in the first wave of the pandemic. Nearly 1 in 3 adults younger than 50 hospitalized with COVID-19 required intensive care, and nearly 1 in 10 required an unplanned readmission to hospital after discharge.” People hospitalized for COVID-19 had greater use of the ICU, were more likely to be put on a ventilator and had longer hospital stays than people with influenza. “These differences may be magnified by low levels of immunity to the novel coronavirus compared with seasonal influenza, which results from past infections and vaccination,” says Dr. Verma. “Hopefully, the severity of COVID-19 will decrease over time as people are vaccinated against the virus and more effective treatments are identified. There is, unfortunately, also the possibility that variants of the virus could be even more severe.” amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"ee1665dd4cd1e2a9f45b40b8754dc769\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"0231186991,B077J7N2M4,B07JBNJ5H6,1421440385\";",

Three people developed a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). One death has been reported from Washington. The food source linked to the outbreak is still being investigated. Most people infected with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli experience severe stomach cramps, diarrhea (often bloody), and vomiting. Symptoms usually start 3 to 4 days after swallowing the bacteria. Most people recover without treatment after 5 to 7 days. Some people may develop a type of kidney failure (hemolytic uremic syndrome, also called HUS) and would need to be hospitalized.",

        "headline": "Dengue outbreak declared in Cook Islands - Outbreak News Today",
        "main_text": "The Cook Islands, a country of 15 islands in the Pacific, is experiencing an outbreak of dengue fever. According to the Cook Islands government , eight cases of  dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) were confirmed this week. Last week 16 samples were sent to New Zealand LabPlus for verification. So far, 9 of these samples have come back with 8 of those tests positive for Dengue Type-2 and one negative result. Commenting from Pukapuka this afternoon Prime Minister Brown asked Te Marae Ora Public Health to instigate a special tutaka – not dissimilar to Operation Namu that took place on Rarotonga last April. “I’ve asked officials to coordinate an island wide operation tasked with cleaning out potential dengue sites and slashing areas of risk in conjunction with the spraying programme. It’s really important we get on top of this latest outbreak as soon as we can, first on Rarotonga, and then the Pa Enua.” “Numbers of presumed cases for this year are likely to rise above last year’s cases unless we act promptly” the Prime Minister said. The hot spots started around Titikaveka and Ngatangiia but have now spread around the villages of Arorangi, Tereora to Pokoinu, Tupapa and Matavera. As per Te Marae Ora’s Dengue Protocol, the threshold of 5 cases has been reached therefore prompting the Secretary of Health, Mr Bob Williams to declare an outbreak. “Whilst we have confirmation of 8 cases, the number of infected people exceeds this number. Last year there were just over 140 presumed cases. Since the beginning of 2021 Te Marae Ora estimates that at least 60 people on Rarotonga are likely to have or have recently recovered from dengue” Mr Williams said. In addition, a Cook Islands student who travelled back to Auckland recently and has tested positive for Dengue has been admitted to hospital in Auckland as a precaution, isolating the person from others. Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection that causes a flu-like illness which can occasionally develop into severe illness. It develops in tropical and sub-tropical climates particularly in urban and semi-urban areas. The daytime bites of infected female mosquitoes can transmit the virus to humans. Symptoms may include fever, headache, muscle and joint pains, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands, and pain behind the eyes. Severe dengue includes symptoms such as rash, mild bleeding in the nose or gums, and easy bruising. While there is no specific treatment for dengue, early detection and seeking proper medical care lowers fatality rates to below one per cent. Public Health officials are currently implementing a number of measures to keep the dengue outbreak under control. Members of the public can do their part by: Members of the public are being asked to clear up their sections by removing overgrown vegetation and disposing water-retaining containers to prevent a further influx of mosquitos. Public health officials said a 100-400 metre radius of cleared vegetation around homes is required to reduce breeding and resting environments for mosquitos. Last week public health officials in Rarotonga were able to conduct peri-focal spraying around Tepuka-Nikao; Inave, Arorangi; Tikioki-Titikaveka. Officials also recommend the use of mosquito bed nets and installing window screens on homes. The Ministry of Health advises members of the public to see a doctor if they develop fever, experience headaches or nausea, feel pain behind the eyes, or suffer from muscle aches. “Our people cannot be too cautious when it comes to mosquitos,” said Mr Williams. “Keeping sections clear of overgrowth and preventing mosquito bites will assist government efforts to reduce the number of mosquitos and prevent further spreading of dengue fever.” amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"68f307d446196122fa5732e0a0de66b9\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07HL2QCPV,B07BVK2FQW,B08L7K9Q9M,B075KP5JLH\";",

        "main_text": "In Liberia, the Minister of Health, Dr. Wilhelmina Jallah, has issued a statement declaring polio outbreak within the country as a ‘National Public Health Emergency.’ The bold move by the Minister followed after a detection of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus-2 (cVDPV2) by the National Surveillance System, which has spread throughout the Country from two different environmental sites in Monrovia. This is the first polio outbreak since 2008 in Liberia. The detection of these isolated viruses in Monrovia have spread throughout the Country. Experience from other countries in Africa and around the world had shown that responding as soon as the virus is detected in an environment, swift intervention is needed to curtail its further spread. As a result, the Ministry on February 4, 2021, declared the virus sporadic outbreak as a National Health Emergency. “In line with WHO and the communities for Polio and the International Health Regulation of 2005, recommendations as that in such a case, action supposed to be taken to curtail its further spread; therefore, I am officially declaring this event as a National Public Health Emergency. This means that number one, we have to continue to monitor the situation within the Country; and the second, most important thing we have to do is to interrupt the spread of this polio virus and go back to try and eradicate it,” she declared. Under the National Polio Emergency, Minister Jallah declared immediate measures that include door-to-door polio vaccination campaign in every community across the Country; monitoring the situation within the country to beef up the fight against polio. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"ec0514ff496529b97a7564768e434f78\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B01CKGQMR6,B07Y2BP7F2,B089QSXXV7,B07YZ8YYHB\"; In remarks at a news conference on February 4, 2021, the  Minister of Health promised that her administration would move with deliberate speed in ensuring that children from zero to fifty-nine-month old are vaccinated and registered for national birth certification. “This exercise will be a door-to-door because we do not have to miss any child. We will be going from door-to-door making sure that each child is vaccinated in your home. There will be a lot more coverage on it so you can know when we coming and who will be coming to your homes. Coupled with that exercise, we want to make sure that children births are registered. So this will us be the opportunity to be able to register all of the children and make sure that they have birth certificates. So two things that will be done: we will make sure kids are protected and vaccinated, and then we will make sure that the birth is registered.” Dr Jallah urged all Liberians, babies’ mothers as well as local and international stakeholders to work with the Ministry to defeat the spread of the virus in the Country. “This virus being circulating within the public about a year so we are ready to move things forward quickly to protected the Children. So therefore, all of our teams are ready and we want to bring it to the public officially to let them know that this virus is in the country and the action that will be taken going forward,” she concluded.

Many of the cases are complicated and associated with malnutrition. Humanitarian partners are conducting assessments in the health zone of Bosobolo, North Ubangi, in preparation for a potential intervention. Two other health zones are also being monitored where cases have been notified. A two-year long measles outbreak that killed over 7,000 children had been declared over in August 2020. Measles is a very contagious disease caused by a virus. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. In fact, the measles virus can stay in the air for up to two hours after an infected person was there. People may be infected by simply being in a room where an infected person once was. It is so contagious that if one person has it, up to 90% of the people around him or her will also become infected if they are not protected.

        "main_text": "South Carolina health officials announced today the detection of two cases associated with the SARS-CoV-2 variant that first emerged recently in South Africa. These are the first two cases of this variant in the United States. The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) was notified late yesterday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of a South Carolina sample that was tested at LabCorp and determined to be the B.1.351 variant originally identified in South Africa. Also, DHEC’s Public Health Laboratory tested samples on Jan. 25 and yesterday identified a separate case of the same variant. “The arrival of the SARS-CoV-2 variant in our state is an important reminder to all South Carolinians that the fight against this deadly virus is far from over,” said Dr. Brannon Traxler, DHEC Interim Public Health Director. “While more COVID-19 vaccines are on the way, supplies are still limited. Every one of us must recommit to the fight by recognizing that we are all on the front lines now. We are all in this together.” At this point in time, there is no known travel history and no connection between these two cases. Both are adults; one from the Lowcountry and one from the Pee Dee region. “We know that viruses mutate to live and live to mutate,” Dr. Traxler said. “That’s why it’s critical that we all continue to do our part by taking small actions that make a big difference. These include wearing our masks, staying at least six feet apart from others, avoiding large crowds, washing our hands, getting tested often, and when we can, getting vaccinated. These are the best tools for preventing the spread of the virus, no matter the strain.” Experts agree that existing vaccines work to protect us from this variant, even if we don’t know precisely how effective they are. At this time, there’s no evidence to suggest that the B.1.351 variant causes more severe illness.",

This person was infected with an influenza A(H3N2) variant (A(H3N2)v) virus. The patient is a child < 18 years of age, was not hospitalized, and has completely recovered from their illness. Investigation into the source of the infection revealed that the child lives on a farm with swine present. This is the first influenza A(H3N2)v virus infection detected in the United States in 2021. Cannibal sandwiches and the health risks Swine flu viruses do not normally infect humans. However, sporadic human infections with influenza viruses that normally circulate in swine and not people have occurred. When this happens, these viruses are called “variant viruses.” Infections with H3N2v have mostly been associated with prolonged exposure to pigs at agricultural fairs. Limited human-to-human spread of this virus has been detected in the past as well (Iowa, West Virginia) but no sustained or community spread of H3N2v has been identified at this time.",

        "main_text": "Following the report out of South Carolina two days ago concerning the first two cases in the US associated with the SARS-CoV-2 variant that first emerged recently in South Africa, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announced today a confirmed case of COVID-19 caused by the new B.1.351 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a Maryland resident. The case announced today involves an adult living in the Baltimore metro region. The individual has not traveled internationally, making community transmission likely. “State health officials are closely monitoring the B.1.351 variant of SARS-CoV-2 in the state,” said Governor Hogan. “We strongly encourage Marylanders to practice extra caution to limit the additional risk of transmission associated with this variant. Please continue to practice standard public health and safety measures, including mask wearing, regular hand washing, and physical distancing.” The B.1.351 variant has not been shown to cause more severe illness or increased risk of death when compared to other variants. The variant is believed to be more transmissible than other strains. Additional research is still required to determine the effectiveness of available vaccines against the B.1.351 variant. However, initial evidence suggests that vaccines are still likely to be protective against the variant. It is also expected that currently available diagnostic tests will detect the B.1.351 variant.

        "main_text": "The new Brazilian variant of COVID-19 is already present in 91 percent of COVID-19 cases analyzed in the state of Amazonas, which is experiencing a dramatic health collapse, according to a study released Friday. The research, carried out by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) , a leading medical research center in Latin America, reveals a rapid spread of the new Amazonian variant that could indicate a greater power of transmissibility. In December, the one named “P.1” was detected in 51 percent of the samples analyzed in the laboratories and in the first half of January that percentage jumped substantially to 91 percent, which confirms that it has been become the predominant lineage in Amazon. In this sense, the fact that it shares mutations with the variants originating in the United Kingdom and South Africa, and that it has been found more frequently in genetic studies, suggests that it is “more transmissible”, according to Felipe Naveca , a researcher at the Leônidas Institute. & María Deane, linked to Fiocruz.

They say more than twice as many people have contracted Yersinia infection as during the same period in the immediately preceding years. An increased number of patients has mainly been observed in the regions of Stockholm, Västra Götaland and Halland, which together account for 33 of the total of 48 disease cases reported since 11 January. Of the patients, a majority are aged 11-40 and most are women. In the ongoing investigation, the Swedish Public Health Agency collaborates with the infection control units in the affected regions to try to identify the source of the infection through interviews of the cases and questionnaires. As part of the outbreak investigation, the Swedish Public Health Agency also collects Yersinia isolates from cases of disease in the affected regions. The isolates are typed using whole genome sequencing (analysis of the genome of the bacterium) to clarify who has been affected by a common source of infection.

Close to 160 confirmed cases have been recorded in Warder Woreda of Dolo Zone and 47 suspected cases in Dolo Ado Woreda of Liban Zone. The suspected cases are awaiting confirmation. The World Health Organization (WHO) is supporting the outbreak response through coordination, disease and entomological surveillance, sample collection and transportation, supply of medicines, social mobilization, and on-the-job training on case management at the health facilities in the affected zones. Contributing factors to the outbreak include weakened nutritional status of the community due to prolonged drought and population displacement. WHO representative , Dr Boureima Hama Sambo, underscored the need to destroy mosquitoes’ breeding sites and prevent mosquito bites to interrupt transmission of dengue fever. “Families and communities need to care for the most vulnerable such as women, children and persons with chronic illnesses, and also seek medical attention immediately when feeling unwell,” he added.  Dr Sambo also called for continued government leadership and strong public health measures to scale and speed up the response and halt the spread of dengue fever.",

        "main_text": "Today, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) issued a public health advisory due to Lassa fever. Lassa fever remains a major public health challenge in West Africa with Nigeria bearing the highest burden. Lassa fever occurs throughout the year but more cases are recorded during the dry season i.e. November through May. This year through January 17, NCDC has reported 226 suspected cases, 23 confirmed cases and four deaths among the confirmed cases. While the numbers are lower than 2020’s record year, the case fatality rate (CFR) of 17.4% which is higher than the CFR for the same period in 2020 (17.1%). In total for 2021, 5 States have recorded at least one confirmed case across 12 Local Government Areas. Lassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) caused by the Lassa virus. The natural reservoir for the virus is the Mastomys natalensis rodent (commonly known as the multimammate rat). Other rodents have also been identified who carry the virus. Lassa fever is spread through: 1. Direct contact with urine, faces, saliva or blood of infected rats. 2. Contact with objects, household items and surfaces or eating food, contaminated with urine, faeces, saliva or blood of infected rats. 3. Person to person transmission by contact with blood, urine, faeces, vomitus, and other body fluids of an infected person. Signs and symptoms of Lassa fever: Lassa fever presents initially like any other febrile illness such as malaria. Its symptoms include fever, headache, sore throat, general body weakness, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, muscle pains, chest pain, and in severe cases, unexplainable bleeding from ears, eyes, nose, mouth and other body openings. The time between an infection and appearance of symptoms of the disease is 3 to 21 days. Early treatment and diagnosis increases the chances of survival. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"8c54415493fd1a9fc205c825fea6ca9f\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"1555818749,0323555128,0702039357,1498593860\";",

He has no recent travel history and his main activity area is around his home where rodents have been infested. The case began to show symptoms such as chills, fatigue, and night sweats one after another since January 8th, and went to the clinic for medical treatment. On January 15th, the symptoms did not improve, and symptoms of fever and headache appeared. They went to the hospital for medical treatment and were admitted to the hospital. Hantavirus was confirmed. The patients condition is stable and he has been discharged from the hospital and returned home to recuperate. Taiwan reported 11 cases last year was higher than the cumulative number from 2016 to 2019 (4, 0, 1, 3 cases, respectively). Health officials say the public should pay attention to the path that rats may invade in the environment. Kitchen waste or animal feed at home should be properly handled, and dead spots where rats may hide in the home should be removed; restaurants, restaurants, food stalls, markets, food factories and other businesses should pay attention to environmental hygiene and get rid of rodents in buildings, and relevant anti-rodent measures shall be taken to prevent epidemics. The Department of Disease Control stated that Hantavirus syndrome is a zoonotic disease. Humans are at risk of infection if they breathe in or come into contact with dust and objects contaminated with mouse feces and urine, or are bitten by rodents carrying the virus. The incubation period of hantavirus hemorrhagic fever infection is several days to two months. The main symptoms are sudden and persistent fever, conjunctival congestion, weakness, back pain, headache, abdominal pain, anorexia, vomiting, etc., bleeding symptoms appear on about 3 to 6 days , Followed by proteinuria, hypotension or oliguria, some patients will experience shock or mild nephropathy, and may progress to acute renal failure, the condition can be improved after treatment.

        "main_text": "Norway’s National Institute of Public Health said in the second update of the risk assessment on variants of the coronavirus that they are likely to become a threat to our ability to control the epidemic in the coming months. New variants of the coronavirus are constantly emerging. The varieties that have the greatest dispersal ability, ie the highest R-number, will eventually dominate. Since such variants spread better, more effective measures are required to keep them under control, explains department director Line Vold. The outbreak in Nordre Follo is the first thing we know about the UK variant in Norway, says Vold. Listen to Outbreak News Interviews on Spotify Nordre Follo municipality and the National Institute of Public Health have collaborated to solve the outbreak. The outbreak at the nursing home must have started in Christmas, but is now, so to speak, over. From the nursing home, there has been a spread to a kindergarten in the municipality and to a nursing home in Oslo. There is also a possible connection with outbreaks at a health station and school in the municipality. There are also some other infected people where the link is being investigated. The further outbreak investigation is in full swing. Sweden issues temporary entry ban from Norway The experience is, as with all other outbreaks, that infection tracing and quarantine were crucial to limit the outbreak. The outbreaks were more or less over before it became clear that the virus was the UK variant. There is still hope of eradicating the UK variant from this eruption. We may not be able to do that next time. If this or other more infectious variants gain a foothold in Norway, they will pose an important threat to the control we now have over the epidemic, says Vold. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health considers that it is moderately likely that the UK variant causes more serious illness and a low probability that current vaccines protect less against the English variant.

Two of the three B.1.1.7 cases were detected in Johnson County, an adult (18 to 40) and a middle aged adult (41 to 60) and an adult individual in Bremer County. The virus variant is often referred to as the U.K. variant because it was first detected in the United Kingdom. Based on epidemiologic and modeling data, researchers believe that the B.1.1.7 strain can be spread more easily than the original strain of SARS-CoV-2. Current COVID-19 vaccines are considered to be effective against the variant strain. “Viruses constantly change through mutation, and new variants of a virus are expected to occur over time. Sometimes new variants emerge and disappear. Other times, new variants emerge and persist. Multiple variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 have been documented in the United States and globally during this pandemic. Public health will continue to work with our partners at State Hygienic Lab to monitor these trends and it is very important that we all keep practicing good public health protective measures,” shared Dr. Caitlin Pedati, State Medical Director and Epidemiologist.",

        "main_text": "In a follow-up on human rabies cases in South Africa, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases ( NICD ) reports the death of a 10-year-old child in the township of Umbumbulu near Durban in the KwaZulu- Natal (KZN) province. NICD reports the boy was bitten by a dog in November 2020. The child was not taken to see a medical professional until after the onset of symptoms. He died on January 7. Laboratory analysis on post-mortem samples were positive for rabies. NICD said a total of seven cases of human rabies was laboratory-confirmed in South Africa, including six in KZN. Disadvantaged communities are disproportionately impacted, with the majority of deaths recorded in children <15 years of age, the NICD notes. In order to achieve zero rabies deaths, bite prevention education and awareness of rabies are needed. For the effective delivery of PEP, good public awareness of rabies and access to treatment are critical. Timely prophylaxis, including wound cleaning, vaccines and occasionally rabies immunoglobulin, are required for people exposed to rabies. In South Africa’s public health care facilities, human rabies vaccines and immunoglobulin are provided free of charge.

        "main_text": "The Simcoe Muskoka Health District reports genome sequencing on all six COVID-19 samples from a Barrie long-term care home have now been identified as the United Kingdom (UK) variant that has proven to be highly contagious and easily transmitted. “The rapid spread, high attack rate and the devastating impact on residents and staff at Roberta Place long-term care home has been heartbreaking for all,” said Charles Gardner, Medical Officer of Health for the Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit (SMDHU). “Confirmation of the variant, while expected, does not change our course of action. We remain diligent in doing everything we can to prevent further spread.” On Wednesday January 20, SMDHU confirmed that preliminary laboratory testing of six cases had identified a high likelihood that there was a COVID-19 variant of concern. The second test, a whole genome sequencing test, determined the exact COVID-19 variant, the UK B.1.1.7 variant.  This variant of concern is more easily transmitted, resulting in much larger numbers of cases in a very rapid fashion. The outbreak at Roberta Place long-term care was first declared on January 8. As of yesterday, Friday, January 22, 124 of 127 residents, and 84 staff were positive for the virus, resulting in 29 deaths. In addition, two essential visitors and three external partners have tested positive. Outbreak News Interviews podcast on Spotify Yesterday the health unit in partnership with the Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre accelerated its immunization program, with its mobile immunization team vaccinating all eligible residents and staff at Roberta Place Retirement Lodge retirement home against COVID-19. Beginning this weekend, the health unit, in collaboration with Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre, (RVH) began immunizing residents at the other retirement homes throughout Simcoe Muskoka. In addition, as of January 16, eligible residents of all long term care facilities in Simcoe Muskoka have received their first dose of immunization against COVID-19. It’s important that everyone continue to strictly follow public health measures to reduce and prevent transmission of the virus: wear a mask, physically distance from those outside your household, wash your hands frequently, leave your home only for essential reasons (in keeping with the provincial Stay at Home Order), and if you have symptoms self-isolate at home and get tested for COVID-19. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"150eea7ba8a545bdf237092b67a0cac4\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07X6GQY5L,B01J47HFWA,B071KDB3R6,B072JJKPX8\"; British Columbia: Salmonella outbreak reported in Pine Siskins Canada: Alberta reports first case of the South African variant of COVID-19 Ontario: Dr. Richard Schabas says ‘Misguided efforts to control COVID-19 only compounding the tragedy’",

        "main_text": "Health officials in Isiolo County in central Kenya were alerted in November 2020 to a number of herders who died who presented a number of symptoms to include fever, headache, nosebleeds and vomiting blood, among others. The Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus was confirmed in mid-December 2020. As of 22 January 2021 , there were four confirmed cases, 17 suspected cases and nine deaths (case fatality ratio 43.0%). All those affected were male, herders, and aged between 13 and 70 years. Two counties are affected by the outbreak, Isiolo and Garissa counties. The outbreak is currently restricted to the two above counties, but potential movement of livestock and people across borders poses a risk of spread at national and regional levels Outbreaks in animals had been seen during this time period and surveillance in livestock was initiated. In December 2020, results from the Kabete veterinary laboratory taken from 120 animals showed 19 sheep and one camel to be positive to RVF using IgM capture ELISA. Kenya has previously experienced outbreaks of RVF, most recently in June 2018 and in November 2014. Rift Valley Fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever that causes illness in animals (such as cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, and camels). Most people with RVF have either no symptoms or a mild illness with fever, weakness, back pain, and dizziness. A small percentage (8-10%) of people with RVF develop much more severe symptoms, including eye disease, hemorrhage (excessive bleeding), and encephalitis (swelling of the brain). Most people recover within one week. Approximately 1% of people who get RVF die. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"4b967698e4f8f2574c3835bf8c9501a6\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B08FPNRYXN,B087KVSMKC,B08FBK2DK5,B088W1QJP1\"; NOMA: Neglected disease, disease of poverty Kenya reports anthrax outbreak in Sotik Plague in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: Nearly 300 cases in Ituri since August Yellow fever outbreak in Senegal SARS-CoV-2 variant: Africa CDC statement",

        "main_text": "China reported it’s fourth rabies case caused by organ transplantation on January 2019 since 2015 and details of the case are described in Biosafety and Health in December. The donor of the organs was a 57-year-old male farmer who was hospitalized in November 2018 of continuous abdominal pain and syncope. He was later transferred to another hospital with a diagnosis of acute intestinal obstruction. His condition continued to worsen and was declared brain dead and a family member suggested an organ donation program– a total of five organs, including left and right corneas, double kidneys, and liver were transplanted to 5 recipients, respectively. The donor had no history of exposure or rabies-related symptoms. The deceased recipient was a 38-year-old female patient of uremia who received the renal transplantation at on November 11, 2018. She recovered and was discharged two weeks later. Maryland resident contracted rabies through organ transplant: CDC The study states: On January 2, 2019, the recipient developed a fever and occasional swallowing discomfort while drinking water. On January 3, she was hospitalized again and developed frequent and urgent urination, aerophobia, tight throat, chills, and hyperhidrosis. In the morning of January 4, symptoms as cyanosis of lips, tight throat, cold limbs, bucking while drinking water, anemophobia, vomiting with white foamy contents, and fever were seen. Together, shock occurred with the loss of consciousness and insensitivity to light (pupils were equal and round bilaterally). Finally, recipient No.1 was declared dead. The rest of the recipients did not develop rabies-related symptoms but were immediately given the rabies immunoglobulin and vaccinated.

Active screening programs set for rabies before organ transplantation can also help reduce the risks. Paralytic rabies, often ignored in clinical practice, is a sign of warning. In this report, we strongly call for the inclusion of rabies into the active screening program before the organ transplantation schemes and legislation of regulations to prevent and control such cases, so as to reach the goal of eliminating human rabies by 2030.",

        "main_text": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Monday that that on any given day in 2018, 1 in 5 people in the U.S. had a sexually transmitted infection (STI) and showed the incredible cost that goes with it. CDC released the following estimates: “The burden of STIs is staggering,” said Jonathan Mermin, M.D., M.P.H., director of CDC’s National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. “At a time when STIs are at an all-time high, they have fallen out of the national conversation. Yet, STIs are a preventable and treatable  national health threat with substantial personal and economic impact. There is an urgent need to reverse the trend of increasing STIs, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected many STI prevention services.” STIs can have serious health consequences. People with these infections do not always experience disease symptoms, but, if left untreated, some STIs can increase the risk of HIV infection, or can cause chronic pelvic pain, pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and/or severe pregnancy and newborn complications. STIs cost the U.S. healthcare system billions of dollars annually HIV and HPV infections acquired in 2018 were the costliest STIs in the new CDC analysis, as medical costs for these infections include lifetime treatment for people with HIV and treatment for HPV-related cancers. Other reportable STIs, including chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis, have substantial medical costs as well. Of the estimated $16 billion in lifetime medical costs from STIs acquired in 2018: The total cost of STIs far exceeds the medical cost burden estimated in this study, which did not include costs associated with lost productivity, other non-medical costs, and STI prevention. “Proven STI prevention – at all levels – is a cornerstone of protecting America’s health, economic security, and wellness,” said Raul Romaguera, acting director for CDC’s Division of STD Prevention. “There are significant human and financial costs associated with these infections, and we know from other studies that cuts in STI prevention efforts result in higher costs down the road. Preventing STIs could save billions in medical costs, but more importantly, prevention would improve the health and lives of millions of people.” Focusing STI prevention on those hardest hit and the need for better data COVID-19 has underscored the underlying effects of systemic health and social inequities that put racial and ethnic minority groups and other populations at increased risk of infection. Similarly, there is an ongoing disproportionate burden of STIs among certain racial and ethnic groups; among young people between 15 and 24 years old who accounted for nearly half of all new STIs in 2018; and among women, who account for a disproportionate burden of severe STI outcomes and medical costs. CDC’s new estimates are critical to better understanding the scope of STIs in the U.S. However, the findings also highlight gaps in the scientific literature and the ongoing need for more data. This includes the need for population-based STI screening estimates to provide a better picture of diagnosed and undiagnosed STIs in groups disproportionately affected, including some racial/ethnic minority groups and people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or and queer/questioning LGBTQ. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"813bd519ed024516c6ad66793f4ed9f4\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B01AMGV8BG,0071624376,B07WXJZMYY,B07KY6HHJW\"; Innovative strategies critical to addressing the STI epidemic At a time when the COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating racial and ethnic health disparities, straining the public health infrastructure, and creating additional challenges to delivering healthcare services, new strategies for increasing access to quality sexual healthcare are critical.

        "main_text": "In 2019, the number of Guinea Worm disease cases tallied were 53 , with most cases reported from Chad, nearly double the number seen in 2018. Today, the Carter Center reports the total cases in 2020 has dropped back down to 27 cases in 6 countries. In addition, Guinea worm infections in animals fell 20% in the same period. During 2020, only 12 human cases of Guinea worm disease were reported in Chad, a dramatic 75 percent reduction from 48 the previous year. Eleven cases were reported in Ethiopia, and one each in South Sudan, Angola, Mali, and Cameroon. As for Guinea worm infections in animals, Chad reported 1,570 (1,507 domestic dogs, 61 domestic cats, and two wild cats), Ethiopia reported 15 (eight domestic dogs, three domestic cats, four baboons), and Mali reported eight infected domestic dogs. Got Smallpox? “The Chad Ministry of Health Guinea Worm Eradication Program saw a significant reduction in both human cases and animal infections in 2020,” said Dr. Kashef Ijaz, Carter Center vice president of health programs. “This was achieved through recommitted country and community efforts, innovation, and aggressive, science-based interventions. The dramatic reductions may be an early indication that we’re turning a corner in the most Guinea worm-endemic country.” Jimmy Carter: ‘I’d like for the last guinea worm to die before I do’ When The Carter Center established itself as a pioneer in neglected tropical disease elimination by assuming leadership of the global Guinea Worm Eradication Program in 1986, about 3.5 million human cases occurred annually in 21 countries in Africa and Asia. Only one human disease has ever been eradicated; that was smallpox, in 1980. For a disease to be declared eradicated, every country in the world must be certified free of human and animal infection, even countries where transmission has never taken place. To date, 199 countries have been certified free of Guinea worm; only seven have not, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where no case has been reported since 1958. After three consecutive years of indigenous transmission, Angola has been added, as the 22 nd country, to the list of endemic countries for the first time. Cameroon was certified by the World Health Organization as Guinea worm-free in 2007; that country has reported one case in each of the last two years but is not endemic because it has not had three years of indigenous transmission. Guinea worm disease: A discussion about the ‘fiery serpent’ Guinea worm disease (dracunculiasis, officially) is usually contracted when people consume water contaminated with tiny crustaceans (called copepods) that carry Guinea worm larvae. The larvae mature and mate inside the patient’s body. The male worm dies. After about a year, a meter-long female worm emerges slowly through an excruciatingly painful blister in the skin, often of the legs or feet. A sufferer may seek relief by dipping the affected limb in water. However, contact with water stimulates the emerging worm to release its larvae into the water and start the process all over again. Guinea worm disease incapacitates people for weeks or months, reducing individuals’ ability to care for themselves, work, grow food for their families, or attend school. Thoughts on the eradicator of smallpox: ‘You can argue that he’s may of saved more lives than any other single human being in human history’ Without a vaccine or medicine, the ancient parasitic disease is being eradicated mainly through community-based interventions to educate people and change their behavior, such as teaching them to filter all drinking water and preventing contamination by keeping patients from re-entering water sources. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"fae189a353cae91e19c9fbe5f334f896\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B012OZ5P4Y,9352701860,1555814409,1498593860\"; Guinea worm disease resurfaces in South Sudan Kenya certified as Guinea Worm free, Maternal and neonatal tetanus is next DRC report 1,000 more monkeypox cases in 2020, Deaths double Kenya Rift Valley fever outbreak: 21 cases, 9 deaths since November NOMA: Neglected disease, disease of poverty",

According to MLHD, there have been 18 cases notified from  1 – 22 January. There were less than five notified cases in the same period in 2020. There have been no arbovirus detections in sentinel chickens, however Ross River was detected in mosquito trappings on 19 th January in the Griffith area. To date, mosquito numbers have been down on previous seasons. However, residents and visitors in the area are advised to take precautions to avoid mosquito bites and minimise potential exposure to the virus. The symptoms of Ross River fever include fever, chills, headache, aches and pains which typically begin within three weeks of being bitten. Tiredness and sore and swollen joints can also occur. A rash may appear for the first 7 – 10 days of illness in some people. Symptoms can subside after a few weeks but some people may experience them for weeks or even months. People should see their doctor if they experience these symptoms. People can reduce their risk of getting Ross River fever by avoiding being bitten by mosquitoes.

        "headline": "India malaria mosquito, Anopheles stephensi, now widespread in the Horn of Africa - Outbreak News Today",
        "main_text": "Larvae of a new malaria mosquito species are abundantly present in water containers in cities in Ethiopia. The mosquito, Anopheles stephensi, is the main malaria mosquito in India but only appeared on the African continent a few years ago. It has now been found in cities and towns in urban settings in Ethiopia, Sudan, and Djibouti. Researchers from the Radboud university medical center and the Armauer Hansen Research Institute in Ethiopia showed that the invading mosquito species is highly susceptible to local malaria strains. Malaria can therefore become an increasing problem for urban areas in Ethiopia and elsewhere in Africa. In Africa, malaria is traditionally been a rural disease with towns and cities associated with much lower levels or absence of malaria. This is due to the fact that most African malaria mosquitoes breed in rural areas. However, the introduction of Anopheles stephensi may increase the malaria risk for urban populations. Over recent years there have been increasing reports of the Asian mosquito species Anopheles stephensi in the Horn of Africa. Anopheles stephensi can reproduce particularly well in man-made containers with clean water. This makes Anopheles stephensi a notorious mosquito species for urban malaria The Asian mosquito appears to be particularly susceptible to African malaria A mosquito species only poses a health risk if it can spread local malaria parasites. “That is why we performed mosquito feeding experiments with the blood of Ethiopian malaria patients. This allowed us to determine whether the local malaria parasite can develop in the new mosquito,” explains Professor of Epidemiology of Tropical Infectious Diseases Teun Bousema of Radboud university medical center in Nijmegen. “To our surprise, the Asian mosquito turned out to be even more susceptible to local malaria parasites than our Ethiopian mosquito colony. This mosquito appears to be an extremely efficient spreader of the two main species of malaria”. With this important puzzle piece, concerns about urban malaria in Africa are increasing. In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) already sounded the alarm about the possible consequences of the invasion of Anopheles stephensi in Africa. With this new findings, these concerns seem justified. “An aggressive approach to target this mosquito is now a top priority,” concludes dr. Fitsam Tadesse. “Only if we act quickly can we prevent the spread to other urban areas on the continent. We must target the mosquito larvae in places where they now occur and prevent mosquitoes from spreading over long distances, for example via airports and sea ports. If that fails, the risk of urban malaria will rise in large parts of Africa.” About malaria With approximately 216 million cases and 400,000 deaths per year, malaria is one of the most important infectious diseases of our time. Compared to the situation before the year 2000, there is a clear decrease in the number of sick people, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and South America. Unfortunately, malaria now seems to be on the rise in several areas where it was previously under control. Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax are the main types of malaria for humans. They are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes and vice versa. There are about 60 mosquito species that can transmit human malaria. In Africa, a number of mosquito species are traditionally responsible for the most malaria transmission. Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes have been labeled the most dangerous animal species on earth and are especially common in rural settings in Africa. Spraying with Insecticides and the use of impregnated mosquito netting against mosquitoes are among the most effective ways to combat malaria. Since 2015, a vaccine has been registered for use. This vaccine, Mosquirix, offers some protection against Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the deadliest form of malaria. Preventing the spread of malaria is considered one of the greatest challenges in the fight against malaria.",

        "main_text": "The Statens Serum Institut in Denmark reported today on the first case of virus variant B.1.351 / 501Y, which was originally detected in South Africa. The Danish covid-19 case of B.1.351 / 501Y was found on Zealand and is associated with a trip to Dubai. The variant has both the 501Y mutation, which is associated with greater infectivity, and the 484K mutation, which may lead to a decrease in sensitivity to the protective antibodies in patients who have recovered from COVID-19 infection. At the same time, the Statens Serum Institut (SSI) has found four covid-19 cases with another virus variant, which only has the E484K mutation in the Spike protein, which as mentioned before may be associated with reduced sensitivity to the protective antibodies. “We have strengthened the monitoring of virus variants so that we can closely follow the development in variant B.1.1.7, which also has the 501Y mutation, but not the 484K mutation. At the same time, this means that we are discovering several other variants that have international attention, such as B.1.351 / 501Y. It has also been shown to be more contagious just like B.1.1.7 ”, says SSI’s Acting Technical Director Tyra Grove Krause. The B.1.1.7 variant currently accounts for 3.6% of all the positive covid-19 samples sequenced in Denmark. However, it is expected that the incidence will increase in the coming weeks and months. How much depends on how well you manage to check the contact number. The Danish case of B.1351 / 501Y has been found by SSI’s general sequencing monitoring. It takes place in collaboration with Aalborg University and now covers all PCR-detected cases of infection with a response time of now less than a week.

According to the Minister for Health, Dr Ifereimi Waqainabete, the cases were reported in the provinces of Cakaudrove and Macuata. Typhoid fever is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by the bacterium Salmonella typhi . Salmonella typhi lives only in humans. Persons with typhoid fever carry the bacteria in their bloodstream and intestinal tract. In addition, a small number of persons, called carriers, recover from typhoid fever but continue to carry the bacteria. Both ill persons and carriers shed S.typhi in their feces. You can get typhoid fever if you eat food or drink beverages that have been handled by a person who is shedding S. typhi or if sewage contaminated with S. typhi bacteria gets into the water you use for drinking or washing food. Therefore, typhoid fever is more common in areas of the world where handwashing is less frequent and water is likely to be contaminated with sewage. Subscribe to Outbreak News TV Typhoid fever can be successfully treated with appropriate antibiotics , and persons given antibiotics usually begin to feel better within 2 to 3 days. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"f2e6432f0099c0dc130f6433801db63f\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"0807021032,B0001WTWPQ\";",

        "main_text": "Agriculture officials in Leyte province in the Visayas region of the Philippines are reporting Africa swine fever (ASF) in several barangays (villages). Blood samples taken from hogs in Abuyog tested positive for ASF, the first case reported in the Eastern Visayas. “Samples collected were submitted to the Regional Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory VIII, which yielded positive results for 4 out of 7 samples tested using ASF antigen detection rapid test,” Agriculture Regional Director Angel Enriquez said in a statement, referring to barangay Canaporong and Bunga in Abuyog town. He said officials will take steps to stop the spread of the vir us. Abuyog Mayor Lemuel Gin Traya said as part of their containment measures, no hogs would be allowed entry and exit until February 14. Swine culling will be conducted in areas with ASF, and owners will be compensated for the loss. Pigs infected with the ASF virus experience high fever, depression, loss of appetite, redness of ears, abdomen, and legs, vomiting, and diarrhea that may lead to death. At present, there is no vaccine or treatment for ASF. Because ASF can spread easily, hog raisers are advised not to feed raw or undercooked pork products (swill, garbage, or waste) to pigs. Also, to monitor the animals daily for any sign of illness, to isolate those found to be sick, and to contact the veterinarian immediately for medical intervention. Preventive measures for pig handlers may include handwashing when they get home from a farm or market; and cleaning of shoes, or tires of vehicles used in the pig farm. Although ASF is not a threat to human health, infected animals are unfit for consumption under the Food Safety Act.

Johnson went on to say that all current evidence continues to show that both the vaccines currently in use remain effective both against the old variant and this new variant. 5.4 million people across the UK have now received their first dose of the vaccine and over the last 24 hours we can report a record 400,000 vaccinations. In England one in ten of all adults have received their first dose, including 71 per cent of over-80s and two thirds of elderly care home residents.",

The data is taken from insurance claims from IBM Watson Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Databases for inpatient, outpatient, and prescription services covering >25 million privately insured US residents <65 years of age. “Our estimate addresses the last of these; it reflects the overall societal and clinical burden of Lyme disease”, the researchers say. The authors conclude: Our findings underscore the large clinical burden associated with Lyme disease diagnoses in the United States. Evolving electronic medical and laboratory systems should help fill demonstrable data gaps and enable more robust and reliable monitoring of changes in the magnitude and spread of the disease. Effective interventions are needed, and improved awareness among clinicians and the public is paramount to foster early and accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"3bb38c4d32555caf079ba5d8787a676e\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B085M66LH1,B084J4QQK1,B08C4KWM9T,B06XCQKTKR\";",

        "main_text": "The Philippines Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the detection of the first case of B.1.1.7. SARS-CoV-2 (UK) variant in the country. The DOH announced that the Philippine Genome Center confirmed the detection of the UK variant in the Philippines after samples from a Filipino who returned home from the United Arab Emirates on Jan. 7 yielded positive genome sequencing results. The male patient with the new strain of Covid-19 is a resident of Quezon City who flew to Dubai on Dec. 27 for business purposes and arrived in the Philippines on Jan. 7 via Emirates Flight No. EK 332. The patient was with his partner who tested negative for Covid-19 upon arrival. Both of the returning Filipinos had no exposure to a confirmed case prior to their departure to Dubai nor had any travel activities outside Quezon City (QC). Immediate contact tracing was done in close coordination with the QC government, and the initially identified contacts are asymptomatic and currently under strict home quarantine. The DOH continues to work closely with the QC LGU to ensure timely and effective measures are in place to mitigate transmission. Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte said he hoped the new variant would not be “more dangerous and toxic” than the original strain. Earlier this week, the Philippine government, represented by Vaccine Czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., Serum Institute of India (SII) and Faberco Life Sciences, Inc., have signed a Term Sheet to secure the supply of 30 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine Covovax, which will be available starting third quarter of this year. “This is a significant milestone in relations between India and the Philippines. It shows that we don’t have to look far beyond Philippine shores to find friends who are willing to help each other out,” Kishore Hemlani, Founder of Faberco Life Sciences Inc., SII’s Philippine partner, said after the signing with Sec. Galvez. “The vaccine will be used to vaccinate 15 million vulnerable and poor Filipinos. The vaccine is stable at 2°C to 8°C, the standard temperature that is within the existing cold chain system in the Philippines, thus allowing its distribution to the remotest barangays,” said Faberco Life Sciences Medical Director Dr. Luningning Villa. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"b623501fed72e33147cafca20a8e22b5\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"039951144X,1734124105,B07F68GD8H,1743794916\";",

        "headline": "First case of the UK COVID-19 variant detected in Illinois - Outbreak News Today",
        "main_text": "Health officials in Chicago and the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) today announced the first case in Illinois of the SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 first identified in the United Kingdom. The case was identified by the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine through sequencing analysis of a specimen from bio-banked samples of COVID-19 positive tests. The new strain was first identified in the United States about two weeks ago in Colorado and has since been identified in several other states. Evidence suggests that this variant can spread more easily than most currently-circulating strains of COVID-19, but there is no evidence that the new strain affects the sensitivity of diagnostic tests or that it causes more severe illness or increased risk of death. In addition, data suggest current vaccines will be effective and safe in providing protection against the variant. “This news isn’t surprising and doesn’t change our guidance around COVID-19. We must double down on the recommended safety strategies we know help stop the spread of this virus,” said CDPH Commissioner Allison Arwady, M.D. “In order to protect Chicago, please continue to wear a mask, practice social distancing, wash your hands often, do not have outside guests in your home, and get vaccinated when it is your turn.” CDPH, IDPH and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in collaboration with various public health agencies, are closely monitoring this strain. “When we learned of this and other COVID-19 variants, we increased our surveillance efforts by performing genomic sequence testing on an increased number of specimens,” said IDPH Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike. “We will continue to collaborate with our academic partners, local health departments like CDPH, hospitals, and the CDC to monitor for additional cases.” A follow-up case investigation by CDPH found that the individual had travelled to the UK and the Middle East in the 14 days prior to the diagnosis. CDPH has worked to identify close contacts of the individual to reinforce the importance of adherence with quarantine and isolation measures. CDPH is also working with the CDC and IDPH to contribute to national SARS-CoV-2 strain surveillance. Building regional capacity and coordination for this more advanced, specialized molecular laboratory public health work is a top priority for CDPH.  Last year, prior to the detection of this variant, CDPH awarded $3 million to lay the groundwork for a Regional Innovative Public Health Laboratory, in partnership with Rush University Medical Center and working with laboratories and academic centers across the City, to increase public health surveillance of possible COVID-19 variants in the Chicago region. “It is important to monitor the spread of virus variants,” said Dr. Egon Ozer, an assistant professor of medicine in infectious diseases at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. “We expected this variant to show up eventually. We will continue to sequence and study these samples.” Some data show a higher concentration of the virus in the respiratory tract for the UK variant that could be related to a higher infectivity and easier spread of the variant, but this needs to be confirmed, Ozer said. Some modeling and molecular data also seem to indicate the variant may attach more strongly to the receptor of the human cell, but this also remains under study. Importantly, no data suggests an increased severity of illness, and early studies have shown the vaccine is still effective against this variant. Dr. Ozer, Dr. Judd Hultquist, Dr. Ramon Lorenzo Redondo and their team in the Northwestern Pathogen Genomics and Bioinformatics Group have been sequencing virus samples obtained from the Northwestern Medicine Diagnostics Molecular Biology Lab and other collaborating institutions.  Their goal is to identify populations of SARS-CoV-2 viruses circulating in the city and see how they change over time in their ability to cause disease and spread. In December, the Northwestern team sequenced 180 random residual samples from individuals who came to Northwestern clinics or other sites for COVID-19 testing or screening that would have otherwise been discarded. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"7ebc320e2005447570274c95236fa6d9\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B06Y2FFQB9,B01A4W8AUK,B089LRZC73,B08KWFWXKJ\"; The COVID-19 virus – also known as SARS-CoV-2 – like other viruses, constantly changes through mutation, and new variants of a virus are expected to occur over time. According to the CDC, this variant is estimated to have first emerged in the UK during September 2020. Other novel variants of SARS-CoV-2, which also might change the way the virus transmits or behaves, have been identified in South Africa, Nigeria, Brazil, Japan and the US. More novel strains are likely to be identified in the coming weeks and months. As a pre-cautionary measure, the CDC earlier this week announced that all international passengers headed to the United States will first need to show proof of a negative coronavirus test, a policy which goes into effect on Jan. 26. The new policy requires all air passengers, regardless of vaccination status, to get a test for current infection within the three days before their flight to the United States departs, and to provide written documentation of their test results or proof of having recovered from Covid-19. Everyday preventive actions by the public can help to slow the spread of all known COVID-19 variants, including wearing a mask, washing hands often, staying six feet away from others and avoiding crowds, avoiding non-essential travel and getting vaccinated when it is your turn.",

The provinces with the highest incidence include Mae Hong Son, Rayong, Nakhon Ratchasima, Chaiyaphum and Chainat. Aedes aegypti mosquito Subscribe to Outbreak News TV Dengue is a viral infection transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. There are four closely related but antigenically different serotypes of the virus that can cause dengue (DEN1, DEN 2, DEN 3, DEN 4). Dengue Fever (DF) – marked by an onset of sudden high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, and pain in muscles and joints. Some may also have a rash and varying degree of bleeding from various parts of the body (including nose, mouth and gums or skin bruising).Dengue has a wide spectrum of infection outcome (asymptomatic to symptomatic). Symptomatic illness can vary from dengue fever (DF) to the more serious dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) – is a more severe form, seen only in a small proportion of those infected. DHF is a stereotypic illness characterized by 3 phases; febrile phase with high continuous fever usually lasting for less than 7 days; critical phase (plasma leaking) lasting 1-2 days usually apparent when fever comes down, leading to shock if not detected and treated early; convalescence phase lasting 2-5 days with improvement of appetite, bradycardia (slow heart rate), convalescent rash (white patches in red background), often accompanied by generalized itching (more intense in palms and soles), and diuresis (increase urine output). Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS) — Shock syndrome is a dangerous complication of dengue infection and is associated with high mortality. Severe dengue occurs as a result of secondary infection with a different virus serotype. Increased vascular permeability, together with myocardial dysfunction and dehydration, contribute to the development of shock, with resultant multiorgan failure.",

On 22 December 2020, the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Algete, Madrid (National Reference Laboratory for TSEs, accredited under UNE-EN ISO/IEC 17025 standard) received a nerve tissue sample suspected to be infected by bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) from the Regional Laboratory for Animal Health in La Rioja, Finca “La Grajera” (official regional laboratory), after a positive result was obtained through a HerdCheck BSE Antigen Test Kit (Idexx Laboratories) rapid test. The National Reference Laboratory carried out the confirmation tests authorized according to EU Regulation No. 1148/2014. The selected test was the BioRad inmuno-blotting TeSeE Western Blot (Ref:3551169), with a positive result. Afterwards, tests for BSE strain discrimination were carried out through hybrid immunoblotting with antibodies against PrP, confirming atypical BSE (H type strain). The sample was taken within the national TSE surveillance program (sampling of dead or non-slaughtered for human consumption animals over 48 months old). The animal was a crossbred cow born on April 20th 2003. BSE is an animal disease that affects cattle (it belongs to spongiform encephalopathies transmissible subacute group (TSE). They are degenerative diseases of the central nervous system that are caused by agents called “pathogenic prions”. The BSE is characterized by the appearance of nervous symptoms in adult animals. The characteristic symptoms of the disease are changes in behavior and locomotor disorders. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"beb4fe97bd389eee27e4b3cb0802d5a5\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B00856PC4K,B07CP6LRVX,1119382866,0367336227\";",

In India, bird flu was first reported in India in 2006 and since 2015 every year some cases are reported. But, till today India has reported no case of transmission to humans,” he said. He also added, “There is no treatment for it, we can only keep precautions. We have directed the state government to dispose of the dead birds carefully. Only Kerala and Haryana have reported cases in poultry. In Kerala the virus was found in duck and in Haryana in poultry.” Bird deaths have been recorded in Rajasthan, Kerala, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, and the government has identified 12 epicentres after the positive samples in four states: Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala. “There is no direct evidence that AI viruses can be transmitted to humans via the consumption of contaminated poultry products. In India, the disease spreads mainly by migratory birds coming into India during winter months i.e. from September – October to February – March. The secondary spread by human handling (through fomites) cannot be ruled out,” the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying said. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"7c7c86039c43f6fada792b1dfb1cc906\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B08DHFX4FV,B08BTJ5JZ8,B084JHKT7S,B0849L2DM3\"; Teddy Cambosa is a graduating BS Biology student and a former campus journalist at Batangas State University.

        "main_text": "The Mayor took the decision as the formal Chair of the London Resilience Forum following discussions with leaders from NHS London, local authorities, Public Health England and the emergency services in the capital. It comes as the number of Covid-19 cases in London has exceeded 1,000 per 100,000, putting immense pressure on an already stretched NHS. Between 30 December and 6 January, the number of patients in London hospitals grew by 27 per cent (from 5,524 to 7,034) and the number on mechanical ventilation grew by 42 per cent (from 640 to 908). Over the last three days alone the NHS has announced 477 deaths in London hospitals following a positive test for Covid-19. The 7,034 people currently in hospital with Covid-19 represents a 35 per cent increase compared to the peak of the pandemic in April. There are currently around 830 admissions to London hospital trusts per day – up from around 500 before Christmas – which could rise further over the next two weeks. The impact is also being felt right across the emergency services with hundreds of firefighters from London Fire Brigade once again assisting London Ambulance Service by volunteering to drive ambulances as the ambulance services faces one of the busiest times in its history. Since volunteering to help in April last year, firefighters have now responded to 100,000 incidents whilst driving ambulances. The London Ambulance Service is now taking up to 8,000 emergency calls a day now, compared to 5,500 on a typical busy day. A major incident is defined as being “beyond the scope of business-as-usual operations, and is likely to involve serious harm, damage, disruption or risk to human life or welfare, essential services, the environment or national security”.  In addition, “the severity of the consequences associated with a major incident are likely to constrain or complicate the ability of responders to resource and manage the incident.” The Mayor re-established a Strategic Coordinating Group in September as the spread of the virus increased.  He has now taken this further step as the increased pressures on responders, combined with the impact of increasing numbers of their staff being ill or having to self-isolate, means that the existing coordination arrangements need to be further stepped-up. The Mayor has written to the Prime Minister with asks from City Hall and London Councils leaders for greater financial support for Londoners who need to self-isolate and are not able to work, daily vaccination data, the closure of places of worship and for face masks to be worn routinely outside of the home, including in supermarket queues and other places outside that may be crowded. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"d4e6a8f05e7a25111a939c9aea5e00e4\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07YG8QTN6,B07VC383LJ,B07KY1XKRQ,B07DNSQRL7\"; The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: “The situation in London is now critical with the spread of the virus out of control. “The number of cases in London has increased rapidly with more than a third more patients being treated in our hospitals now compared to the peak of the pandemic last April. “Our heroic doctors, nurses and NHS staff are doing an amazing job, but with cases rising so rapidly, our hospitals are at risk of being overwhelmed. The stark reality is that we will run out of beds for patients in the next couple of weeks unless the spread of the virus slows down drastically. “We are declaring a major incident because the threat this virus poses to our city is at crisis point. If we do not take immediate action now, our NHS could be overwhelmed and more people will die. “Londoners continue to make huge sacrifices and I am today imploring them to please stay at home unless it is absolutely necessary for you to leave. Stay at home to protect yourself, your family, friends and other Londoners and to protect our NHS.” Georgia Gould, Chair of London Councils, said: “Cases are rising at a dangerous rate in London, putting extreme pressure on the NHS. “One in 30 Londoners now has Covid. This is why public services across London are urging all Londoners to please stay at home except for absolutely essential shopping and exercise. “We know how tough this is for Londoners. Councils are here to support anyone struggling to access food or medicine. “Today, the thoughts of London leaders are with the thousands of Londoners in hospital battling Covid and the amazing carers fighting to save lives. We owe it to them to do all we can to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe. “This is a dark and difficult time for our city but there is light at end of the tunnel with the vaccine rollout. We are asking Londoners to come together one last time to stop the spread – lives really do depend on it.”",

It is believed the victim was bitten or scratched by a bat nesting in the attic of his house. In August 2019, he died encephalitis, the cause of which was not known. A partnership established between the Necker hospital and the Pasteur Institute, aimed at identifying the causes of undocumented encephalitis, led to the genetic analysis of post-mortem samples. These analyzes at Necker Hospital in Paris showed that he had contracted a lyssavirus, European Bat Lyssavirus type 1 (EBLV-1). “It’s been 35 years since such a death happened in the world. And in mainland France it’s really the first. In Russia, in 1985, only one other case of human encephalitis caused by this strain was confirmed, and two more cases of rabies were described in Finland in 1985 and in Scotland in 2002. They were caused by a different species of bat lysavirus, and killed two scientists specializing in bats research,” Laurent Dashe, deputy head of the Pasteur Institute’s national rabies reference center told AFP. He suggested that “the patient had contact with bats nesting in his attic.” Dashe said rabies has been officially eradicated in France since 2002, adding that “the last death related to non-flying animals in France occurred in 1998.” France reports 1st case of SARS-CoV-2 variant France COVID-19: 70 departments are in a situation of high vulnerability Prion disease: Technician in France diagnosed with vCJD more than 7 years after lab exposure amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"1e19d99b0ce6ed1fb1b71132cd85d3ed\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"0143123572,0323639798,613015092X,B00YRU66WU\";",

The first case detected is a citizen residing in Lima, who is in home quarantine. Two other cases among her relatives are undergoing the sequencing technique. “We are expanding the circle by looking for more cases. The truth is that we already have the variant of COVID-19 in Peru, “said Mazzetti. The minister explained that this variant of the coronavirus is more contagious, but that it can be avoided by following the same prevention measures. “Our behavior is the most important thing to avoid contagion,” he warned. “There is no magic pill here, there is no self-medication, what we have to avoid is contagion with a good use of the mask -covering up to the nose-, avoiding crowds, closed and crowded places, and with constant hand hygiene”, she recommended. In addition, she indicated that the vaccines that Peru has acquired are effective against this new variant of COVID-19. Non-native mosquito, Aedes scapularis, established in South Florida Dexamethasone warning The Ministry of Health also warned self-medication with dexamethasone by people with COVID-19 could affect their health, generate complications that require their admission to Intensive Care Units (ICU) and even cause death. “The unnecessary use of dexamethasone can reduce the response capacity of our body’s defenses, which is essential to face the attack of any virus. Added to this are effects such as weight gain, fluid retention, swelling, weakening of bones, muscle atrophy, increased blood pressure and increased sugar levels in diabetics ”, explained specialists from Digemid. “In case of feeling any discomfort or suspecting that the disease has been contracted, go to the nearest health center, where the doctor will evaluate your case and determine the treatment to follow, which must be to comply with it respecting the prescribed doses.” Peru tops 1 million COVID-19 cases, increased restrictions and ivermectin use warning COVID-19 vaccines Health officials clarified to the public that, by law, the distribution and application of the emergency vaccine against COVID-19 will be free for all those inhabitants of the national territory over 18 years of age who wish to obtain it.

The Brazil Ministry of Health says passengers disembarked in the Japanese capital on January 2, after a season in Amazonas, developed mild symptoms and were quarantined at Tokyo airport. According to information supplied to the Ministry of Health by the Japanese health authorities, the new variant has 12 mutations, one of which is the same found in variants already identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa, which implies a greater potential for transmission of the virus. However, there is no scientific evidence that points to an impact on the effectiveness of laboratory diagnosis or vaccines under study currently against Covid-19. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"2b57fddbaedda3c75f7e6c56ca749009\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B0775G1S95,B08G4Y58XS,B08CX9Q42L,B07RQ7JB68\";",

The traveler was found to be positive on 28 December 2020 and has been segregated for further treatment. Since October 2020, the MOH has been monitoring all travelers from countries that have reported cases of UK B.1.1.7 variant mutations including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Singapore, Turkey, the Philippines and India. A total of 968 samples have been tested since October 2020 and have performed genome sequencing to detect this type of UK B.1.1.7 mutation to 24 samples. As of 11 January 2021, no domestic transmission has been detected in connection with the UK B.1.1.7 mutation virus. MOH through the Institute of Medical Research (IMR) and the National CPRC will constantly monitor the development of this UK B.1.1.7 mutation and will inform from time to time. Although this UK B.1.1.7 mutation has not been found to cause severe symptoms, however, it can spread easily and quickly.

        "main_text": "According to a recent UNICEF Humanitarian Report , in Ituri province in northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), officials have reported 286 cases of bubonic plague, including 27 deaths were reported since August. Rethy and Biringi health zones have the highest number of cases, with 210 registered cases, including 15 deaths. In a letter to ProMED mail published Thursday, officials with EcoHealth Alliance also report on the bubonic plague outbreak in Biringi health zone reporting some 150 suspected cases from mid-November to mid-December. Of the total, overall, women and men are equally affected; however, adolescents (under 17 years old) seem the most at risk, representing 78.9% of the sick people, they write in the letter. The authors write: In this region, where there are nearly 47,000 internally displaced refugees from South Sudan, with some moving freely between the 2 countries, the risk of a regional flare-up is to be considered if the epidemic also reaches this camp. Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium, Yersinia pestis . It is found in animals throughout the world, most commonly rats but other rodents like ground squirrels, prairie dogs, chipmunks, rabbits and marmots in China. Fleas typically serve as the vector for plague. People can also get infected through direct contact with an infected animal, through inhalation and in the case of pneumonic plague, person to person. Yersinia pestis is treatable with antibiotics if started early enough. There are three forms of human plague; bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"6edef764798e3603d07303ef76bb55c1\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B08GQZYSWK,B08698VM3X,B07FM71DC6,B01LBUE83M\";",

        "main_text": "On December 22, 2020, the 19th meeting of the COVID-19 advisory board of Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare met to look at the latest infection trends in Japan. At that time, the advisory board said concerning Tokyo: The number of new infections in Japan continues to increase, reaching a record high level. It maintains an upward trend in the Tokyo metropolitan area (mainly in Tokyo), and no obvious decrease is seen in the Kansai and Chubu areas. The number of new infections in Tokyo continues to increase, exceeding 30 per 100,000 persons in the last week. The medical care provision system also continues to be in a very tough situation. It is becoming difficult to accept severe patients. There is a growing need to divert the beds for usual care in order to secure beds for patients with coronavirus disease. Effective efforts are required to suppress infections. While the route of infection is unknown in many cases, the spread of infection via gathering to drink and eat is anticipated. The number of new infections also increases in Saitama, Kanagawa and Chiba throughout the metropolitan area, making the medical care provision system be in a severe situation. In Tokyo, the effective reproduction number was below 1 temporarily in late November. But it turned to be 1 or more after that, and the same level continues. Despite a request for shortened opening hours, no decrease in the flow of people has been seen. Japan reports 5 cases of new SARS-CoV-2 variant Then came December 30, 2020 when Tokyo saw the highest number of cases during the pandemic with 1337–the first time ever eclipsing the 1000 case/day mark. This prompted Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, Saitama Gov. Motohiro Ono, Kanagawa Gov. Yuji Kuroiwa and Chiba Gov. Kensaku Morita issued the request to Yasutoshi Nishimura, the government’s coronavirus point man, to declare a state of emergency to combat the surging coronavirus. “We agreed that we are in a severe situation that warrants us considering the declaration of a state of emergency,.” Nishimura said, adding that the government needs to consult with its coronavirus expert panel before making a decision. Since the record high day last week, Tokyo has seen cases decrease with 783 new cases on Dec. 31 and 814 on Jan. 1. In total, Tokyo has reported 61,774 cumulative COVID-19 cases, including 631 deaths. 1M chickens to be culled after Japan deals with another bird flu outbreak Japan reports 5,000 syphilis cases fourth year in a row Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in Japan: Trends show it may not be so rare amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"379c8720a65505f6948caf86c82d5669\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"1503612252,1640971173,4805312793,4805313617\";",

All positive COVID-19 tests in New Zealand are sent to ESR for whole genome sequencing as part of our overall elimination strategy. As part of routine sequencing of these particular cases, matches to the UK variant were confirmed. The six cases, five of whom travelled from the United Kingdom and one who travelled from South Africa, arrived into New Zealand between 13 and 25 December and underwent routine testing in managed isolation as part of routine surveillance testing or because they developed symptoms. Once confirmed positive they were transferred to the Auckland quarantine facility. Four of these cases are now recovered and, after a final health check, were able to leave the facility. The cases are all cared for with the same high level of infection prevention measures  as all COVID-19 positive cases, with daily health checks and use of PPE. Infection prevention control protocols are in place for all staff and we can assure the public that there is no increased risk to the community. The UK variant is more transmissible than other variants of the virus but there is no evidence at this stage that the length of the infection period is any different to any other variant of COVID-19, nor is it more likely to produce severe illness. All cases detected in managed isolation must meet the recovered case definition before being allowed to leave the facility as assessed by the medical team. This includes a period of at least 72 hours without any symptoms and a minimum of 10 days since symptom onset or a positive test.",

        "main_text": "The Norwegian Institute of Public Health has detected the COVID-19 virus variant in two people who came to Norway from the United Kingdom in December. The infection detection teams in the municipalities will now follow up in accordance with current routines for people who are diagnosed with the English virus variant, with extra testing and closer follow-up of close contacts to reduce the risk of possible further spread, says department director Line Vold at the National Institute of Public Health. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health is the national reference laboratory for coronavirus. The institute collects viruses from all the country’s microbiological laboratories for examinations of their genome (the overall genetic code). The institute has strengthened its monitoring of changes in viruses to detect the English virus variant and any other new virus variants that may have changed infectivity or other properties. Additional measures have also been implemented at the borders to reduce the risk of further introduction of the new virus and other viruses. The English virus variant appears to be more contagious than the common coronavirus, but it does not appear to give any greater risk of serious illness from what we know at present. A few cases of this variant have been detected in a dozen European countries, but there is reason to believe that the variant can also be found in countries where the genome of the virus is not examined, and therefore no mutations can be detected. When more countries start with such surveys, we will gain a better insight into the prevalence of this variant, Vold explains. It is currently only in parts of England that it is considered that the variant may have contributed to rapid growth in the epidemic. Investigations are still underway to be able to say something more certain about this. In Denmark, the virus has been present for several weeks without changing the infection situation. There is reason to be cautious, but at the same time it is still uncertain how important the variant plays for the spread of infection, Vold concludes and continues: – The usual measures against the epidemic, such as staying home when you are ill, testing, infection detection and quarantine, keeping distance and fewer participants at gatherings will be important infection control measures against this variant as well. So far, no evidence has been reported that the effect of the vaccine has been affected. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"88f18a17411ff36540a41f8e0253d12d\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07VMRPW5X,B07T2YW2SK,B08FX5MHQ9,B08NJCGRTK\";",

        "main_text": "South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa in a statement to the country spoke of the COVID-19 pandemic on Monday. Here is an excerpt: The number of new coronavirus infections is climbing at an unprecedented rate. More than 50,000 new cases have been reported since Christmas Eve. The majority of new cases are emerging in KwaZulu-Natal, the Western Cape, Gauteng and the Eastern Cape. Infections are also alarmingly on the rise in Limpopo. Infections are on the rise in part because, as humans, we are social beings and have a need to socialize with one another. We feel the need to visit friends and family, we attend religious services and we go to parties. But this is a time of heightened danger in the face of a global pandemic. Across the world countries are having to take drastic measures to curb new waves of infections. We will all have heard that there is a new variant of COVID-19 that is now well-established in our country. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"79f0b556e99bf50ae553f6e200681f0a\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B08CXB5D7Q,B07ZFWDBL6,B086Z244ND,B004J2KDH0\"; As our scientists study this variant – called 501.V2 – and its spread, it appears that it may be more contagious than the virus that drove the first wave of infections. The rapid rise in infections is being fueled by so-called super-spreader events, including like end-of-year functions, family and social gatherings, and music and cultural events. This is a cause for great alarm, and points to an extreme lack of vigilance over the holiday period. We have let down our guard, and unfortunately we are now paying the price. This led into Ramaphosa talking of additional restrictions in South Africa, including the restriction of alcohol: One of the more difficult areas of regulation relates to the sale of alcohol. The liquor industry is a major employer and an important contributor to our economy. Our priority at this time, however, must be to save lives. Reckless behavior due to alcohol intoxication has contributed to increased transmission. Alcohol-related accidents and violence are putting pressure on our hospital emergency units. As we had to in the early days of the lockdown, we now have to flatten the curve to protect the capacity of our healthcare system to enable it to respond effectively to this new wave of infections. In such a scenario, every piece of medical equipment, every hospital bed, every healthcare worker, and every oxygen tank is needed to save lives. Therefore, under the strengthened regulations: –    The sale of alcohol from retail outlets and the on-site consumption of alcohol will not be permitted. –    The prohibition on consuming alcohol in public spaces like parks and beaches remains. –    Distribution and transportation will be prohibited with exceptions that will be explained by the minister. Through today, South Africa has reported 1,021,451 cases, including 27,568 deaths.",

        "main_text": "Colorado Governor Jared Polis announced today the state’s first case of the of COVID-19 variant B.1.1.7, the same variant discovered in the UK. The Colorado State Laboratory confirmed and notified the Center for Disease Control (CDC) of the case. The individual is a male in his 20s who is currently in isolation in Elbert County and has no travel history. Public health officials are doing a thorough investigation. The individual is recovering in isolation and will remain there until cleared by public health officials. The individual has no close contacts identified so far, but public health officials are working to identify other potential cases and contacts through thorough contact tracing interviews. “There is a lot we don’t know about this new COVID-19 variant, but scientists in the United Kingdom are warning the world that it is significantly more contagious. The health and safety of Coloradans is our top priority and we will closely monitor this case, as well as all COVID-19 indicators, very closely. We are working to prevent spread and contain the virus at all levels,” said Governor Jared Polis. “I want to thank our scientists and dedicated medical professionals for their swift work and ask Coloradans to continue our efforts to prevent disease transmission by wearing masks, standing six feet apart when gathering with others, and only interacting with members of their immediate household.” The Colorado state lab was the first in the country to quickly identify the variant through sophisticated analysis of testing samples. The lab initially performed the diagnostic PCR test on the sample and found that the sample was positive for COVID-19 with strong signals for the N gene and ORF1ab (both are detected when a person has COVID-19), but the signal for the S gene was not detected. When the S gene doesn’t register in the testing, it is called an “S Drop Out Profile,” and it is considered an essential signature for the variant. The sample was flagged for further investigation. Scientists then sequenced the viral genome from the patient sample and found eight mutations specific to the spike protein gene associated with this variant. Genome sequencing is a molecular profiling of the entire viral RNA sequence. Scientists in the United Kingdom believe the B.1.1.7 variant to be more contagious than previously identified strains of the SARS-CoV-2 variant, though no more severe in symptoms. In addition, the currently approved vaccines are thought to be effective against this variant. “The fact that Colorado has detected this virant first in the nation is a testament to the sophistication of Colorado’s response and the talent of CDPHE’s scientist and lab operations,” said Jill Hunsaker Ryan, executive director, Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. “We are currently using all the tools available to protect public health and mitigate the spread of this variant.” amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"79f0b556e99bf50ae553f6e200681f0a\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B00O4SSLRI,B084NTHJ7Y,B003D124JI,B08D52V5BG\";",

At 20:30 on December 14, Shanghai CDC received notification from the Shanghai Customs that the patient tested positive for COVID-19. By 22:00, the patient was transported by ambulance from the isolation point to the fever clinic of Jiading District Central Hospital. Due to travel history from the UK and abnormalities in nucleic acid test results, the hospital organized a consultation with experts and formed a recommendation to transfer the patient to Fudan University’s Public Health Clinical Center for further diagnosis and treatment, which was carried out the following day. On December 15, Jiading District CDC retested using a nasopharyngeal swab sample and the nucleic acid result was positive for COVID-19. An epidemiological investigation revealed that the patient had a negative COVID-19 test result on December 12, 2020, two days before her flight to return to China. According to her statement, she had no exposure to symptomatic individuals and had not purchased or been exposed to frozen food products or raw meat. While remaining in the UK, the patient described running in a nearby park without wearing a mask and taking off her mask to eat and drink while waiting to board the plane. These are all potential situations for exposure, especially with 1.86 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 having been reported in the UK as of December 15, 2020. At the time of case report, the patient was diagnosed as a mild case according to the epidemiological investigation, symptoms and laboratory test.

        "main_text": "In a follow-up report from earlier this week in California, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency reported three new cases of the United Kingdom variant of COVID-19, also known as B.1.1.7. by whole genome sequencing Thursday. The three newly-confirmed variant cases reported were confirmed by by Scripps Research. The new cases of the UK strain were found in men, two in their 40s and one in his 50s. Contact tracing shows two men did not travel outside of the county while the third case has yet to be fully interviewed. None of the men had any known interaction with each other or the other confirmed case. A household contact of the first local B.1.1.7. strain case reported Wednesday has been hospitalized for COVID-19, with whole genome sequencing pending. The discovery of the additional cases leads County Health Officials to believe that the new strain of the virus is widespread in the community. The four individuals who have tested positive for the B.1.1.7. strain live in La Mesa, Mission Beach, Otay Mesa and the Carmel Mountain/Rancho Bernardo area. In light of the high case numbers and new strain being detected in the region, County health officials urge San Diegans to: Related: amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"661c31c9a721134d518b02b260cba12a\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B088GVB2S5,B087G8PFFZ,B08HGRX51F,B07GYXYWQF\";",

        "main_text": "Officials with Public Health – Seattle & King County are reporting an increase in shigellosis cases since mid-December in King County. Since the end of October, Public Health has received 40 total reports of Shigella infection, with 22 of those reported since December 14th. This compares to an average of 2-3 cases reported during a typical week this year. Public Health has had 173 reported cases of Shigella in 2019 and 129 cases in 2020 from preliminary data. Among the recent infections, 28 cases occurred among people who reported experiencing homelessness or unstable housing or who accessed homeless services. These cases have occurred across multiple settings and no common source among the cases has been identified. “Outbreaks of Shigella among people living homeless are often a reflection of the lack of access to medical care, basic hygiene and sanitation resources,” said Elysia Gonzales, Medical Epidemiologist, Public Health – Seattle & King County. “ Shigella is highly contagious. It’s important that anyone with symptoms of Shigella contact a healthcare provider for potential testing and treatment to help decrease the spread of preventable illnesses among our most vulnerable residents.” Shigella bacteria spread easily from one person to another because it takes as few as 10 germs to make you sick. Symptoms of shigellosis include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps. Most people get better after about one week but can be sick longer or become dehydrated and need medical care. People can also be contagious even after feeling better. The germs can spread when someone with Shigella does not wash their hands well after using the toilet then contaminates objects, food or water. Shigella also spreads easily through sexual contact. Handwashing with soap and water is the best way to protect yourself and others against Shigella infections. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"37f988be2697a5caec9aed95dafd3630\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B075B9JZ1Z,B077H2M35K,B089RNLXNR,B07Y27HW4M\";",

        "main_text": "In a follow-up report from Sweden , an additional four cases of the covid-19 variant reported from the UK have now been detected in Sweden. The lab analysis work has been intensified, and it was not unexpected that more cases would be discovered. The analysis have been particularly focused on samples from people who tested positive after staying in the UK, both recently and back in time. “That we would find more cases of the new virus variant was expected. This shows that we have had an impact on the increased analysis work and handling of the cases”, says state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell. The new variant of the covid-19 virus, called VOC202012 / 01, has been in the UK since September. The variant is believed to have an increased dispersal ability compared to other variants, but analyzes of its properties are still ongoing. The new cases in Sweden have been discovered in several different regions. In order to capture more possible cases, the Swedish Public Health Agency will continue and intensify the work with the extended sample analyzes. “At present, the new cases do not affect the Swedish Public Health Agency’s risk assessment of the situation. But the findings remind us of the importance of everyone in society following current advice and recommendations to reduce the spread of infection”, says Anders Tegnell. The Swedish Public Health Agency has previously urged all entrants who have stayed in the UK from 12 December to stay at home for at least seven days, to avoid contact with others as far as possible and to test as soon as possible after arrival with a follow-up test five days after arrival. The rest of the household should also stay at home waiting for test results. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"0b0ccc8d4afc2597b4654f912ced9274\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"1421440385,0316343757,0385334818,B006SVHOL8\";",

At 10:30 am, the first dose was applied simultaneously at two points: at the PROPAM long-stay center for the elderly and the CEACO. “This moment represents for the country the beginning of the path to end the COVID-19 pandemic,” expressed the President of the Republic, Carlos Alvarado, very emotional, highlighting the multiple efforts that the country involved in having this vaccine, a promise that today it was finalized with the application of the vaccine to the first four Costa Ricans. This vaccination will be sustained throughout 2020 and 2021, but not massively, so that the support of the population as each health area indicates to their communities when it is appropriate to approach to vaccinate, do so in an orderly manner, respecting the order of the five groups to be vaccinated defined by the National Commission for Vaccination and Epidemiology.

As the test result suggests the variant circulating in the UK, sequencing has been requested from the National Respiratory Infection Viruses Reference Center, which has so far confirmed infection with the VOC variant 202012/01. The person, asymptomatic for Covid19, is currently isolated at his home and is doing well. The health authorities proceeded to contact-tracing of the health professionals who took care of the patient and to the search of his contact persons at risk, to proceed to their strict isolation. A system for detecting and monitoring possible cases of infection or carriage of the VOC 202012/01 variant has been set up by Public Health France and the National Reference Centers, in conjunction with the analysis laboratories. The laboratories send to the CNR for sequencing any positive PCR test results for a person returning from the United Kingdom or having been in close contact with a person returning from the United Kingdom or any PCR test result that may suggest the variant virus. The same procedure has been put in place for people returning from South Africa, where another variant of SARS-CoV-2 is currently circulating actively. To date, several positive samples that may suggest the VOC 202012/01 variant are being sequenced by the CNR laboratories.

England authorities: New COVID-19 strain can spread more quickly, Boris Johnson’s statement, Netherlands travel restrictions The UK has recently reported that a new variant of the covid-19 virus, called VOC202012 / 01, has been spreading in the country since September. The variant is believed to have an increased dispersal ability compared to other variants, but analyzes of its properties are still ongoing. It was not unexpected. We know that this variant has existed in the UK since September and it has also been reported from other countries in Europe in the form of isolated cases, says Karin Tegmark Wisell, head of department at the Swedish Public Health Agency. It is too early to draw any conclusions about the significance of the find for Sweden. This is a first single case, it says nothing in this situation if the variant would have been spread. We continue with the expanded analyzes to see if we can find more cases. But I want to emphasize that it is important that everyone follows the advice and recommendations we have to reduce the spread of covid-19 in society, says Karin Tegmark Wisell. On 21 December, the government decided on a ban on entry from the United Kingdom due to the spread of infection and new variants of the coronavirus that have been reported from there. The Swedish Public Health Agency has decided to urge visitors to stay at home for at least seven days after arriving in Sweden and avoid contact with others as far as possible. The invitation applies to all entrants who have stayed in the UK from 12 December. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"7e1487a9280c86c8d061fcea07f175f9\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B08GC4YGF2,B07N9JMSW6,B082YW2SZX,B08BXSH5Y9\";",

        "main_text": "Public Health Agency of Canada is reporting two confirmed COVID-19 cases in Ontario of the variant observed in the United Kingdom. The National Microbiology Laboratory monitors Canadian cases of COVID-19 with the provinces and territories through ongoing analysis of genomic databases in Canada. As the monitoring continues, it is expected that other cases of this variant and other variants of concern may be found in Canada. Furthermore, as these two cases did not travel outside of Canada, it is important to follow public health measures and limit contacts with others, to reduce the transmission of the virus and any of its variants in communities. The best way to prevent infection with any variant of COVID-19 is to follow public health measures. To reduce the risk of importation of the virus and any of its variants, Canada has had travel restrictions and border measures in place since March 2020, including mandatory quarantine. These rigorous quarantine measures are among some of the strongest in the world. Under 2% of all cases reported in Canada are from those who travelled outside of Canada. All travellers must present their quarantine plan to the Quarantine Officer at the point of entry to Canada, and those with an inadequate plan are directed to a federal quarantine facility. PHAC monitors travellers’ compliance with quarantine and uses law enforcement officers to verify compliance during the 14-day quarantine. Individuals who are not complying with the quarantine requirements can face fines of up to $750,000 or six months in prison. On December 20, in response to concerns about the UK COVID-19 variant, the Government of Canada also suspended all flights from the United Kingdom for 72 hours, subsequently extended until January 6, at 11:59pm. Travellers are since being asked additional health screening questions to help identify if their travel itinerary included a country of concern reporting this variant in the last 14 days prior to appearing at a Canadian port of entry.",

The epidemiological period, beginning in July, totals 87 notifications of epizootic diseases: 11 were confirmed as the death of monkeys infected by yellow fever; 32 were discarded; 35 are identified as indeterminate and 9 are under investigation. During this period, Paraná did not register cases of yellow fever in humans. Of the 10 registered notifications, nine were discarded and one is under investigation. “Although we have no cases of yellow fever in humans, we are on alert for the circulation of the virus due to confirmed monkey deaths. These animals do not transmit the disease; in the same way as man they are contaminated. That is why monkeys are considered sentinels and signalers of the presence of the virus ”, said the Secretary of Health of Paraná, Beto Preto. The Department of Health recommends vaccination against yellow fever to the population. The vaccine is available in the entire public health network and those who are between 9 months of age and 59 years old and have never taken a dose should be vaccinated. Aedes aegypti mosquito The initial symptoms of yellow fever are: sudden onset fever lasting up to seven days, associated with headache, chills, nausea, vomiting, body pain and abdominal pain. These symptoms are confused with other diseases such as leptospirosis, flu or dengue. Yellow fever can progress rapidly, in about 10% of cases, to severe forms with jaundice (yellowing of the skin), severe abdominal pain, bleeding and kidney failure.",

        "headline": "Ebola: Reston virus spreads efficiently in pigs, according to researchers - Outbreak News Today",
        "main_text": "“The emergence of RESTV in pigs is a wake-up call as transmission into humans through direct contact with pigs or the food chain is a possibility,” they state in their study report. Scientists from NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) conducted the work at Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Montana. Scientists first identified RESTV in 1989 in research monkeys shipped from the Philippines to Reston, Virginia. The virus also gained attention in 2008 when an outbreak swept through pigs in the Philippines. That outbreak led to the first association of pig-to-human RESTV transmission, prompting the World Health Organization to issue a global alert in February 2009. RESTV sequences also have been identified in pigs in China, and the scientists suggest officials monitor pigs for disease throughout the Philippines and Southeast Asia. The NIAID scientists conducted their study to answer two key questions: could they cause disease in young pigs—mimicking natural infection with RESTV isolated from the 2008 swine outbreak — and if so, would those pigs shed virus through their respiratory tract? Their work confirmed that in fact the pigs developed severe pneumonia with virus shedding from the upper respiratory tract. They also determined that the age of the piglets at the time of infection—they used animals between three and seven weeks old—did not change the course of disease. Their work involved Yorkshire cross-bred pigs, which frequently are used in commercial pig production systems. RESTV has not been found in commercial pigs in the United States. Continued studies in this project will examine whether co-infection with other swine viruses affects the ability of RESTV to cause severe disease in pigs and whether pigs have a broad role in hosting ebolaviruses.

        "headline": "Majority of people who have had a coronavirus infection retain antibodies for over six months: Finland health officials - Outbreak News Today",
        "main_text": "A study by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) has found that a very large share of people infected with coronavirus in the spring still had detectable antibodies six months later. The main aim of the study was to find out how long the antibodies last in SARS-CoV2 virus infected persons, and thus also to assess the duration of possible protection. A previous study by THL and the City of Helsinki found that nearly all those infected with coronavirus (63/64) formed antibodies, which also remained for a period of four months in most of the participants. Persistence of antibodies examined from samples from coronavirus patients The follow-up study for the serological population study of the coronavirus epidemic began in October. People aged 18 or over, who had a coronavirus infection confirmed by PCR-testing in the spring at least six months prior, were invited to take part in the study. The study subjects were selected on the basis of information from the National Infectious Diseases Register. The first blood samples were taken in early November. To date, 1,164 subjects from five different hospital districts have participated in the study. A microneutralization test developed at THL, was utilized in the antibody study. The microneutralization test measures antibodies that neutralize the virus. Thus far, these antibodies have been found in 792/867 subjects (91%) in the follow-up study. “The fact that antibodies persist in such a large proportion of those infected for a long time is a promising finding, and, in particular, the persistence of neutralizing antibodies can mean longer-term protection from new infection,” says THL’s Research Manager Merit Melin. Other recent studies have also shown that neutralizing antibodies persist in a large proportion of those infected, despite a decrease in total antibodies in the months following infection. The immune response resulting from a coronavirus infection can be influenced by both the characteristics of the virus and the differences between individuals. Coronaviruses that cause severe infections, such as SARS and MERS, can produce antibodies that persist for several years. The THL study found neutralizing antibodies in all 129 COVID-19 patients who had been hospitalized. Other studies have also shown that patients with severe COVID-19 develop higher levels of antibodies, which also persist longer. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"26e3a8ec765ee2b86f6fc09505e90fab\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B0072NWKG0,0128187050,0323639798,B000GBNXA2\"; Neutralizing antibodies can protect against infection The neutralizing antibodies formed in infected persons are likely to provide protection against symptoms or severe symptoms of a new infection, as evidenced by animal experiments. However, it is not yet known which amount of antibodies is sufficient to protect a person from an infection or how long the protection will last. Neutralizing antibodies target the viral spike protein, on which the majority of vaccines under development are also based. In clinical trials, coronavirus vaccines have produced as good or stronger antibody responses compared to natural infection. International studies have found that the levels of neutralizing antibodies achieved with new types of mRNA vaccines were high in both young adults and older people. The effectiveness of vaccines has been equally good in people of different ages. “Our observation that neutralizing antibodies persist in most people for more than six months after infection also increases optimism about the long-term protection provided by vaccines,” says THL’s Research Manager Arto Palmu. Long-term surveillance of immunity induced by coronavirus infection and by vaccines is important.",

        "main_text": "In a follow-up on the tick-borne dog disease, Ehrlichiosis, in Australia , vets in Top End in Australia’s Northern Territory say some 1000 dogs have died of  the bacterial infection. ABC News in Australia report Bonny Cumming, a vet with Animal Management in Rural and Remote Indigenous Communities (AMRRIC) working across the Top End, said it was hard to gauge how many dogs had died from ehrlichiosis. However, she expected that by the end of the 2020-21 wet season, dog deaths would “be in the thousands.” “What we are seeing is in some regions [ehrlichiosis] is really exploding,” Dr Cumming said. “It has a pretty high mortality rate, especially for younger or older dogs that are immune-compromised. It is really heavily impacting those dogs. Ehrlichia canis occurs around the world, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Infection with E. canis (ehrlichiosis) was confirmed for the first time in Australian dogs in May 2020 in the Kimberley region of Western Australia and June 2020 in the Northern Territory. The disease has also been detected in a small number of dogs in the Gascoyne and Pilbara. E. canis is transmitted primarily by the brown dog tick ( Rhipicephalus sanguineus ), which is widely distributed worldwide and is present in Australia. Ehrlichiosis requires veterinary treatment and early treatment provides the best chance of recovery. The disease cannot be directly passed from infected dogs to humans. In extremely rare cases, ticks infected with Ehrlichia canis may infect people. However human ehrlichiosis is almost always caused by species other than Ehrlichia canis and these species have not yet been found in Australia. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"f195fd98f73ca04e49d54f1263d85b07\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B08J5ZRFRG,B08J5RBMRN,B07XQXPF21,B08J628R4C\";",

The data, collected from November 6 and December 15 this year, reported a total of 52 suspected cases, including 14 deaths. Out of these numbers, a total of 50 cases were reported from the health district of Koundara in north-west Guinea, one from the health district of Dubreka (near Conakry, in the south-west) and one from the health district of Kouroussa. Further analysis done by the Nongo, Conakry Laboratory of Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers shows that 10 of the cases were Immunoglobulin M positive, 8 were from unvaccinated suspect cases from Koundara, 1 was from Dubreka, and 1 from Kouroussa. Another testing done by the Institut Pasteur de Dakar (IPD) in Senegal similarly found that 8 samples from Koundara had signals positive for yellow fever. In response to the outbreak, the Koundara Health District Public Health Emergency Operation Center set up a response coordinated by the Ministry of Health, which includes services such as outbreak investigation, active case finding, initial reactive vaccination around suspected yellow fever cases, clinical management, vector control, risk communication and community engagement. The African nation remains in the list of 27 countries designated by Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics Global Strategy (EYE) as a “high risk endemic country” for yellow fever cases.

In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 infections in Lima and the northern coastal regions of the country, the Government decided to reduce the capacity in commercial centers and conglomerates, close the use of the beaches and extend the curfew , informed the Minister of Health, Pilar Mazzetti Soler. Minister Mazzetti indicated that these measures have been taken based on the monitoring of the pandemic taking into account several indicators, including the occupation of hospital beds, the occupation of COVID-19 beds and mortality. As of Saturday, Peru has reported 1,006,318 confirmed cases, including 37,414 deaths. FDA warning: Ivermectin meant for animals are not for human treatment for COVID-19 In addition on Saturday, Mazzetti announced ivermectin is not a drug that the Ministry of Health (Minsa) recommends as a general treatment against COVID-19 or for preventive use and discouraged indiscriminate use. Although ivermectin is in the Minsa medical guide for the care of COVID-19, it is also clearly established that it is only recommended for mild or outpatient cases with risk factors. “It is not for general use.

        "main_text": "Last week, the South Africa National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) announced changes in SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19. The Network for Genomics Surveillance in South Africa (NGS-SA) reports detecting a new lineage, which is a group of mutated viruses, of SARS-CoV-2 in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal Provinces. This lineage possesses between 10-20 mutations that were not previously seen in viruses from South Africa prior to September 2020. This week, Public Health England (PHE) reported two cases of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant, which originated in South Africa. The 2 cases were identified in the UK on 22 December 2020 and both have been in contact with someone who has travelled from South Africa. The new variant named B1.351 (also referred to as 501Y.V2) was first detected in Nelson Mandela Bay, South Africa, in samples at the beginning of October. Molecular dating suggests that it could have been in circulation from the end of August. The rapid spread of the variant in South Africa could be an indication of increased transmissibility but this is not yet confirmed. PHE is investigating this variant and will share its findings in due course. There is currently no evidence to suggest that the variant has any impact on disease severity, antibody response or vaccine efficacy. Epidemiological and virological investigations are also ongoing in South Africa. It is not uncommon for viruses to undergo mutations; seasonal influenza mutates every year. More than 4,000 variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified in the UK and variants have been observed in many other countries.

Of accumulative total, 129,387 patients have recovered from the disease, 14,658 are active cases and 9076 deaths have been recorded. In addition, the Minister of Health and Sports, Edgar Pozo, reported Thursday that the Government plans to acquire vaccines against COVID-19 before March through bilateral agreements with laboratories in different countries, outside the Covax mechanism. As for vaccines, “we are not only using the Covax mechanism, but also a form of acquisition through bilateral agreements between Bolivia and other countries,” he said at a press conference. He explained that the vaccines that the Government manages through bilateral agreements, obviously you have to buy them, they are not donations, and it is expected to have them in the country until before March of the following year. He indicated that Bolivians over 18 will receive the dose for free. In that sense, he pointed out that 20% of the population will be immunized through the Covax mechanism and the remaining 80% through the independent purchase of different laboratories. It is planned to vaccinate 6% of the Bolivian population against COVID-19 in the first quarter of 2021. So far there have been talks with all the producing laboratories, including Pfizer, Moderna Astrazeneca / Oxford, Sinovac and Sputnik.",

        "main_text": "This new variant is defined by multiple non-synonymous mutations in the spike (S) protein. Three of these mutations are located on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein – the most notable being the N501Y mutation on the receptor binding motif that binds to the human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor . Preliminary analyses from South Africa and the United Kingdom suggest that this new variant may be associated with increased transmissibility and a higher viral load than the previously circulating variants. However, researchers are conducting further investigations on this new N501Y variant to determine if it is more infectious, more transmissible, or has the potential to cause more severe illness. Research is also being conducted to assess the impact of the mutations on the performance of existing molecular diagnostics, serological assays, therapeutics, and vaccines. On 21 December, Africa CDC convened an emergency meeting of the Africa Taskforce on Coronavirus Response (AFTCOR), where the Network for Genomics Surveillance in South Africa, led by Prof. Tulio de Olivera and Prof. Salim Abdool Karim, shared findings from South Africa. The meeting discussed what is known, what is not known, and what needs to be done about this new variant. The Taskforce recommends the following: amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"482056a04f023d2dbd6e6fbc5e6d4299\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B01A4W8AUK,B07PQ8WTC4\"; Recommendations to Member States and health authorities Coincidentally, the news of this variant has come when the continent is also experiencing a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, Africa CDC advises that Member States reinforce their efforts to increase testing, contact tracing and early treatment of cases while we seek to gain more insight about the impact this new variant could have on testing accuracy, clinical outcomes and vaccine efficacy. Specifically, we recommend that: Africa CDC will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates to Member States and the public as more information becomes available about this SARS-CoV-2 variant.

        "main_text": "Los Angeles County health authorities announced this weekend that since Dec.11, more than 100,000 new COVID-19 cases have been reported To date, Public Health identified 610,372 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of L.A. County and a total of 8,817 deaths. There are 5,424 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 21% of these people are in the ICU. Today’s number of people currently hospitalized with COVID-19 is again a new high and an increase of more than 300 patients since yesterday. A recent decision by the Court of Appeal affirms Los Angeles County’s duty to prevent disease transmission and protect public health through existing Health Officer Orders, and the suspension of outdoor dining remains in effect. Public Health reminds all sectors and businesses that all other requirements, safety directives, and temporary business closures also remain in effect. The Los Angeles County Health Officer Order will be modified today to align with recent Supreme Court rulings for places of worship. Places of worship are permitted to offer faith-based services both indoors and outdoors with mandatory physical distancing and face coverings over both the nose and mouth that must be worn at all times while on site. Places of worship must also assure that attendance does not exceed the number of people who can be accommodated while maintaining a physical distance of six feet between separate households. Public Health strongly recommends that places of worship continue to hold services outdoors, with physical distancing and the use of face coverings to prevent the spread of COVID-19 to congregants and to the entire community. Because Los Angeles County is experiencing an unprecedented surge of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, every effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19 to congregants and to the entire community is critical. Yesterday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the second vaccine to prevent COVID-19 severe illness. The EUA allows the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to be distributed throughout the country. Public Health expects doses of this vaccine to arrive in L.A. County next week. Once these doses arrive, they will be used to vaccinate staff and residents at skilled nursing facilities, frontline EMS EMT’s and paramedics, and vaccinators. Currently, the Pfizer COVID-19 initial allocation of vaccine is being used by acute care hospitals to vaccinate frontline health care personnel. A second allotment of Pfizer vaccine is anticipated to arrive next week and will be used to vaccinate additional healthcare workers at acute care hospitals. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"a5be9e328d49b9d2cc4602603c5653c5\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07JVR1JPM,B00BWXBYQ8,9460582079,1510758062\";",

In order to limit the further spread of disease, appropriate restrictions have been imposed on the premises and any identified contact premises. The remaining birds at the premises have been humanely culled and a 10 km temporary control zone has been set up around the infected premises to limit the risk of the disease. Within this zone a range of different controls are now in place. These include restrictions on the movement of poultry, carcasses, eggs, used poultry litter and manure and restrictions on bird gatherings. Producers and bird keepers are reminded to comply with the order to house birds that came in to effect on the 14 December, or ensure they are kept separate from wild birds and follow biosecurity procedures. Minister for Rural Affairs and the Natural Environment Mairi Gougeon said: “With the recent disease confirmations in wild and captive birds in the UK, it is not unexpected for Avian Influenza to be found in birds here in Scotland. We ask that the public remain vigilant and report any findings of dead wild birds.” amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"aad811d8fe80a546d2408f22ba8a58cd\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B01DCHK94Y,1641712260\"; Scotland’s Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: “This case of H5N8 in a flock of birds on Sanday confirms that Avian Influenza is present in Scotland. “We have already made clear that all bird keepers – whether major businesses or small keepers with just a few birds – must ensure that their biosecurity is up to scratch to protect their birds from disease and prevent any contact between their birds and wild birds. Keepers who are concerned about the health or welfare of their flock should seek veterinary advice immediately. Your private vet, or your local Animal and Plant Health Agency office, will also be able to provide practical advice on keeping your birds safe from infection. “Any dead wild swans, geese, ducks or gulls, falcons or other birds of prey or five or more dead wild birds of other species in the same location, should be reported to the Defra dead wild bird helpline. “Public health advice is that the risk to human health from the virus is very low and food standards bodies advise that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers, and it does not affect the consumption of poultry products including eggs.” England reports new variant of SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV-2 in minks in Sweden not the same variant found in Denmark Europe: More than 500 avian influenza detections, Most in Germany Barcelona Zoo reports SARS-CoV-2 in four lions",

The case is a 4-year-old.  The parents took the girl to the Darcy Vargas Hospital, on November 16, with a fever of 39ºC, dyspnea, respiratory distress, runny nose and headache. She is doing well and being monitored at home. It is the second case discovered in the state this year; the first was identified in April, in Ibiporã, in a 22-year-old woman who recovered quickly. A sample was collected for respiratory virus research, evaluated with detection of the virus as Influenza A by the Central Laboratory of the State (Lacen). Then, the sample was sent to the National Reference Laboratory, of IOC-Fiocruz in Rio de Janeiro, which sequenced the complete viral genome and determined the H1N2 subtype. As the occurrence is of compulsory notification, the MS will report to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). At this moment, professionals from the technical areas of Health Surveillance at Sesa Paraná, the State Central Laboratory, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fiocruz are articulating investigation and control actions of the case. A team from the Strategic Information Center for Health Surveillance (CIEVS) and Sesa’s Communicable Disease Surveillance Division was, during this week, in Rebouças carrying out the retrospective analysis of the case, collecting new materials and researching the network of contacts. of the family of the infected child, with support from the Municipal Health Department of Rebouças and the 4th. Regional Health Institute of Irati.

        "main_text": "After reporting a decline in the number of COVID-19 cases since the peak in August, Philippines health officials are seeing a slowing down of the previous improvement in the epidemic curve. On Saturday, the Department of Health reported an additional 3597 COVID-19 cases, bringing the total to 458,044. In addition, 36 additional fatalities were reported today, putting the death toll at 8911. Officials are reminding the public to remain cautious and vigilant during the Christmas holiday season. There has been a continuous growth of cases in Metro Manila, signaling the start of a surge. Nine cities are now at moderate risk compared to last month when all cities were at low risk. The average daily attack rate in all NCR cities is also higher than the national average. Increases have also been reported in Regions I, II, and CAR. If this  trend continues and is not mitigated, it will lead to a sharp spike of cases that might overwhelm our health system capacity, similar to the peak we experienced last August in the NCR. The occurrence of another surge will no longer be a matter of “if” but of “when and by how much”. What does a spike in cases might mean?—the extensive lockdowns and how it has affected our families, our healthcare workers, the small businesses and large enterprises alike, and how it almost, if not completely, paralyzed our economy, officials note. “We do not want that to happen again”. “We would like to remind everyone that while we wait for the vaccine, let us not be complacent. Let us continue adhering to the minimum public health standards and let the gift of safety be our present to our loved ones this holiday season”.

        "main_text": "The Norwegian Institute of Public Health has discovered an increased incidence of the gastrointestinal bacterium Yersinia enterocolitica O3. So far, infection has been detected in 10 people who live in several counties. Outbreak investigation has been initiated in collaboration with relevant municipal chief physicians, the Veterinary Institute and the Norwegian Food Safety Authority. The patients are between 11 and 59 years old, and all are women. The infected live in Innlandet, Viken, Oslo, Vestfold and Telemark, and Vestland. Bacteria with a similar DNA profile have been detected in all 10 people and all samples have been taken during the last two weeks in November and the first week in December. The National Institute of Public Health collaborates with the municipal health service, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority and the Norwegian Veterinary Institute to map whether patients can have a common source of infection. The patients are interviewed and the local Norwegian Food Safety Authority takes samples from food products in the homes of those who are infected, if residues are available, in order to identify the source of the outbreak if possible. Investigation work can be complicated and time consuming, and in many cases it will not be possible to find the source of infection or to clarify whether it is a common source, says senior researcher Umaer Naseer at the Department of Infection Control and Emergency Preparedness. Yersiniosis is an infection caused by the bacterium Yersinia enterocolitica . The most common symptoms are diarrhea, fever and abdominal pain, usually lasting 1-3 weeks. The reservoir for the bacterium is primarily pig. Dogs and cats can also be carriers of the bacterium. Yersinia bacteria are transmitted mainly through food, usually through infected pork products, contaminated vegetables or salads and the use of non-disinfected drinking water. Every year, between 40-80 cases of yersiniosis are reported to the National Institute of Public Health. Most are infected domestically (60-80 percent of reported cases). amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"022c5f347aeaa1e57c259097f64647a8\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07WZHW2J3,B08842D7JS,B081GMHQLR,B0862269YP\";",

        "main_text": "The Louisville Zoo announced Friday that a snow leopard has tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 in humans. The affected animal is a 5-year-old female named NeeCee. The Zoo is awaiting confirmatory results of the other two male snow leopards – Kimti and Meru. All three cats are doing well with very mild symptoms, and the Zoo continues to monitor their health closely. All are are expected to fully recover. It is suspected that they acquired the infection from an asymptomatic staff member, despite precautions taken by the zoo. In April, zoo keepers working with cats, non-human primates, bats and ferrets began wearing PPE when near the animals. All Zoo staff go through a health screening at the start of their day, stay at home if feeling unwell and are tested if symptoms of COVID-19 arise. The United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) says this is the first snow leopard in the United States to test positive for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported in a small number of animals worldwide, mostly in animals that had close contact with a person with COVID-19. At this time, routine testing of animals is not recommended, according to the USDA. To date, 58 Lions, tigers, mink, dogs and cats have tested positive by PCR at initial diagnosis and another 52 dogs and cats tested positive by antibody test.

According to WHO standards, certification of malaria eradication can be granted to a country that has seen no transmission of the disease for three consecutive years, has established a well-supported system of malaria detection and containment and has made practical plans for prevention. Li Bin, deputy director of the National Health Commission said the country has gained abundant expertise and experience in malaria control and elimination over the years, which includes the discovery and use of artemisinin. China will continue to strengthen cooperation for malaria eradication with African countries. Li added.

        "main_text": "Health officials in England are reporting a new variant of the virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified across the South East of England. The variant has been named ‘ VUI – 202012/01’ (the first Variant Under Investigation in December 2020) following an increase in cases seen in Kent and London. As of 13 December, 1,108 cases with this variant have been identified, predominantly in the South and East of England. There is currently no evidence to suggest that the strain has any impact on disease severity, antibody response or vaccine efficacy. Public Health England ( PHE ) will monitor the impact of this in the coming days and weeks. It is not uncommon for viruses to undergo mutations; seasonal influenza mutates every year. Variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been observed in other countries, such as Spain. This variant includes a mutation in the ‘spike’ protein. Changes in this part of the spike protein may result in the virus becoming more infectious and spreading more easily between people. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"4c4ef18591a768b62a453a7aac4cc9f5\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07Q3T1YJS,B011PBH1CC,B07K1RZWMC,B08GHVSGMQ\";",

        "headline": "COVID-19 OTC at-home test receives FDA nod - Outbreak News Today",
        "main_text": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the first over-the-counter (OTC) fully at-home diagnostic test for COVID-19. The Ellume COVID-19 Home Test is a rapid, lateral flow antigen test, a type of test that runs a liquid sample along a surface with reactive molecules. The test detects fragments of proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from a nasal swab sample from any individual 2 years of age or older. “Today’s authorization is a major milestone in diagnostic testing for COVID-19. By authorizing a test for over- the-counter use, the FDA allows it to be sold in places like drug stores, where a patient can buy it, swab their nose, run the test and find out their results in as little as 20 minutes,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “As we continue to authorize additional tests for home use, we are helping expand Americans’ access to testing, reducing the burden on laboratories and test supplies, and giving Americans more testing options from the comfort and safety of their own homes.” The announcement today of the first fully at-home OTC COVID-19 diagnostic test follows last month’s authorization of the first prescription COVID-19 test for home use and last week’s announcement of the first non-prescription test system, in which a lab processes the self-collected sample. The FDA has authorized more than 225 diagnostic tests for COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic, including more than 25 tests that allow for home collection of samples, which are then sent to a lab for testing. The Ellume COVID-19 Home Test is the first COVID-19 test that can be used completely at home without a prescription. “The FDA strongly supports innovation in test development and we have worked tirelessly with test developers to support the shared goal of getting more accurate and reliable tests to Americans who need them. Today is a promising step forward and we are eager to continue advancing additional innovation in COVID-19 testing that the science supports,” said Jeff Shuren, M.D., J.D., director of FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “This test, like other antigen tests, is less sensitive and less specific than typical molecular tests run in a lab. However, the fact that it can be used completely at home and return results quickly means that it can play an important role in response to the pandemic.” Similar to other antigen tests, a small percentage of positive and negative results from this test may be false. Therefore, for patients without symptoms, positive results should be treated as presumptively positive until confirmed by another test as soon as possible. This is especially true if there are fewer infections in a particular community, as false positive results can be more common when antigen tests are used in populations where there is little COVID-19 (low prevalence). The FDA reminds patients that all tests can experience false negative and false positive results. Individuals with positive results should self-isolate and seek additional care from their health care provider. Individuals who test negative and experience COVID-like symptoms should follow up with their health care provider as negative results do not preclude an individual from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The Ellume COVID-19 Home Test uses a mid-turbinate nasal swab (sample is collected further back than the usual nasal swab, but not as far back as nasopharyngeal swabs, which are only appropriate for use by a trained health care provider) to detect certain proteins of the virus known as antigens. The Ellume COVID-19 Home Test correctly identified 96% of positive samples and 100% of negative samples in individuals with symptoms. In people without symptoms, the test correctly identified 91% of positive samples and 96% of negative samples. The Ellume COVID-19 Home Test uses an analyzer that connects with a software application on a smartphone to help users perform the test and interpret results. Results are delivered in as little as 20 minutes to individuals via their smartphone. The mobile application requires individuals to input their zip code and date of birth, with optional fields including name and e-mail address, and reports the results as appropriate to public health authorities to monitor disease prevalence. Ellume expects to produce more than three million tests in January 2021. The FDA continues to work with test developers to expand access to COVID-19 testing and supports further development of COVID-19 tests that can be used completely at home. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"b79203ff0897327e86442a2f8d751fb7\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B08KWFWXKJ,B08GQZYSWK,B0892SMSHM,1684426863\";",

        "main_text": "Officials at the Sir Ganga Ram hospital in Delhi, India are reporting at least 13 cases of COVID-19-triggered mucormycosis, a serious but rare fungal infection, according to multiple local media reports. Times of India reports ,  “In the last 15 days, we have seen 13 cases of COVID-19-triggered mucormycosis. Five have died. At least three patients have suffered vision and have had to undergo removal of the nose and jaw bone to prevent the spread of infection, Dr Manish Munjal, senior ENT surgeon, said. “Usually, we see one to two cases of mucormycosis in a month,” he added. In one case, a 32-year-old who had recovered from COVID-19 experienced a nagging left side nose obstruction, which rapidly became an eye swelling within two days, after which he reached out to the doctors. The left side of his face had become completely numb and he was brought to the hospital emergency in a partially disoriented and obtunded state, according to a Indian Express report. “His tests revealed the presence of steeply elevated sugar and infection levels, but even more deadlier, the presence of a killer rare fungus called Mucor, which was sampled from his nose debris. An MRI revealed that the infection had already destroyed a significant part of his left side sinuses, eye, upper jaw bone and muscles, and even had made passage into the brain,” said Dr Munjal. Low immunity in people recovering from COVID-19, either due to the infection or medications are being looked at as the cause of these unique cases. India: Plasmodium ovale malaria reported in Kerala, Found in soldier returning from Africa Zygomycosis, or mucormycosis, is an acute fungal infection from a number of genera of molds. Infections with these fungi typically cause disease that is rapidly progressive, destructive and associated with a high fatality rate of 50% of higher. It is most prevalent in those with a weakened immune system or other debilitating disease like diabetes. These fungi have an affinity for blood vessels, and cause thrombosis, infarction and tissue necrosis . It is not communicable from person-to-person. India news source, News 18 reports that this is not only being seen in Delhi, but in other cities–Ahmedabad and Bengaluru. In Ahmedabad, Mucormycosis was reported in five patients who were all either suffering from coronavirus or had recently recovered from it–two died and two lost their sight. In Bengaluru, Mucormycosis was reported in four patients linked to COVID-19, in which two died.

The Ministry of Health (SSa) issued an alert due to the detection of at least 10 cases inside a hospital in Nuevo León. Although the name of the hospital has not been revealed, it is stated that the situation is under control and so far the affected patients are reported stable. The report notes the fungus was identified in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. In five cases it was detected in the bloodstream and in the rest in the urinary tract. There are also 34 other people classified as suspects and who remain under review. This report comes on the heels of the first reported case in Brazil . According to the alert of the Epidemiological and Sanitary Intelligence Unit (UIES) of the General Directorate of Epidemiology, the immediate instruction is that all the second and third level Hospital Epidemiological Surveillance Units in Mexico take preventive measures. The first cases of C. auris were detected in South Korea in 2009. Later, others were identified in India, the United States, the United Kingdom, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, and Chile. In Mexico, cases have never been confirmed until now, which implies a new challenge in the field of health. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"07253198b4e929f40a43577d0d728014\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"0803600364,0198755384,1482824124,0898633117\";",

        "headline": "Iran COVID-19: Number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 may be higher than expected, according to seroprevalence study - Outbreak News Today",
        "main_text": "This is the first major seroprevalence study from the Middle East and is published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal . Despite the high seroprevalence rates, the data suggests that there are still large swathes of the Iranian population who remain susceptible to the virus. Seroprevalence data sheds light on the true rate of infection and may indicate the number of people with some degree of immunity, although it is still unknown to what extent previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 is protective and cases of re-infection have already been confirmed globally. It also gives an insight into infection spread as well as the success of public health campaigns, which could guide policy makers as Iran faces a second wave. “We have found that although the overall rate of infection is higher in Iran than anticipated, it is still less than one-fifth of the population, indicating that much of the country is still vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection,” says Professor Reza Malekzadeh, lead author from Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran. “We believe that antibody testing of individuals – including those in occupations at high-risk – should guide local public health decision making on lockdowns, PPE requirements and return-to-work policies.” COVID-19 has caused over 1 million deaths and led to countless hospitalisations worldwide. After its detection in China, Iran was one of the first countries hit during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic, with the first reported death in February 2020. Restrictions on mass gathering and closures of restaurants were implemented in February 2020, and were eased in April. Data collection for the new study took place between 17 April and 2 June 2020 and included people from the general population as well as those in occupations with higher potential for exposure, such as supermarket cashiers, bank tellers and healthcare workers. Participants were invited to take part in the study by telephone call. Blood samples were taken and serum was tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Participants were also interviewed about their demographic characteristics, such as age and sex, their exposure to COVID-19, any recent COVID-19 symptoms, and their medical history. Of 8,902 participants, 3,530 were from the general population. The remaining participants (5,372/8,902) were from occupations with high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. The researchers asked participants to record if they had experienced COVID-19 symptoms to better gauge the relationship between symptoms and infection rate. Overall, 35.7% of cases positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the study reported that they had never developed symptoms, despite having antibodies for the virus. After statistically adjusting for population size and the sensitivity of the serum test, seroprevalence positive rates among individuals who reported being a contact of a COVID-19 case were considerably higher (30.8%) compared to those without (14.0%). Seroprevalence was found to vary widely between cities. The city with the lowest seroprevalence – Sanandaj – had a rate of 1.7% (N=193), compared with the cities of Qom and Rasht, which had seroprevalence rates in the general population of 58.5% (N=349) and 72.6% (N=244) respectively, after adjusting for population and test characteristics. For higher-risk occupations, this rate rose to 80.7% in Rasht. The variation in prevalence estimates among the cities may be partly explained by the early implementation of health measures in some places. For instance, Qom reported a rise in cases very early in the epidemic, partly due to an ongoing trading relationship with Wuhan, China. “We have seen a striking variation in antibody rates across areas within Iran, which underlines the importance of sampling across different geographical areas, and may provide an insight into how the virus spread through the country during the first wave. This indicates that different regions might require personalized public health strategies against SARS-CoV-2, meaning that one size does not fit all,” says, Dr Maryam Darvishian, co-author from Cancer Control Research, Vancouver, Canada. [1] The seroprevalence rate reported in the new study for Iran is higher than that previously reported for the USA, Switzerland, and Spain. This could be due to the timing of the outbreak in Iran, which was among the first countries that reported SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, potentially exposing a higher proportion of the population to the virus. The authors caution that there are limitations to the study and individuals with history of COVID-19 symptoms may have been more willing to participate in the study. Further, the serum test kits used were not fully assessed prior to the study, and although the researchers carried out further validation checks and statistically adjusted the data to allow for test characteristics, the sensitivity of the test used is known to be low. In some cities, including Tehran, some parts of the high-risk population could not be recruited due to lockdown restrictions during data collection. “We hope that our seroprevalence data enables more targeted decision making for public health bodies as we face a second and potentially third wave of infection,” says Professor Malekzadeh. “Our planned follow-up data will provide not only an updated picture of seroprevalence but also an indication of how SARS-CoV-2 antibodies change over time.” amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"0d32eea85dc90b4cdc461011b8cb233e\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B0767MGB9G,0307271811,B07MMLTR7J,1949445070\";",

She notes, Plasmodium ovale, a new genus of malaria, has been detected in the State. It was found in a soldier who was being treated at the District hospital in Kannur. The soldier had come from Sudan. The spread of the disease can be avoided with timely treatment and preventive measures. What is Plasmodium ovale ? It is one of five species of Plasmodium that infects humans ( P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and P. knowlesi are the other four). P. ovale is found mostly in Africa (it’ss endemic to tropical Western Africa and the islands of the western Pacific (rare). It is relatively unusual outside of Africa and comprises less than 1% of isolates where found. It may be new in Kerala, but it’s not exactly new. In 1922, it was observed in the blood of an East African patient some erythrocytes that were oval and with fimbriated edges. The parasite was named P. ovale in recognition of the oval shape of some of the infected erythrocytes. It was considered a variant form of Plasmodium vivax at one time due to the pronounced stippling of the infected erythrocyte and its tertian periodicity. It rarely causes severe illness or death. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"eab4b1aec6742068944513eb67f23772\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"0312573014,1524743410,B00WET7XIC,1555818749\"; Nipah Virus: Study suggests more widespread than previously thought India reports 2.4 million TB cases in 2019 India: 1st novel coronavirus reported in Kerala Nipah virus confirmed in Kerala, India India: Naegleria fowleri death reported in Kerala state",

        "main_text": "European officials report 561 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus detections in wild birds, poultry and captive birds since mid-August from 16 countries, according to a Scientific Report published yesterday . Two-thirds of the detections, or 370, were in Germany, followed by Denmark and the Netherlands. Three HPAI virus subtypes, A(H5N8) (n=518), A(H5N5) (n=17) and A(H5N1) (n=6), and four different genotypes were identified, suggesting the occurrence of multiple virus introductions into Europe. The HA gene of the currently circulating HPAI viruses of the A(H5N8), A(H5N1) and A(H5N5) subtypes form a single genetic group within clade 2.3.4.4b, and cluster with HPAI A(H5Nx) viruses that have been detected in Iraq, Russia and Kazakhstan since May 2020. Four different genotypes, generated through multiple reassortment events with LPAI viruses circulating in wild birds in Eurasia, were identified in Europe. This high genetic variability suggests multiple virus introductions into Europe The bulk (90%) of the detections were in wild birds–mostly in barnacle goose, greylag goose, and Eurasian wigeon. The remainder of the detections were in poultry, where the most likely source of infection was indirect contact with wild birds. European officials say the risk of zoonotic transmission of avian influenza viruses to the general population in Europe remains very low. The evolution of the viruses and recent reassortment events need to be closely monitored in order to assess the ongoing risk of emerging reassorted viruses being transmitted to humans. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"6099229b17d40dc7e512eee9b7c72180\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"1478006986,B00850ZTMG\";",

After at least eight workers on the farm tested positive for COVID-19, five mink samples were collected and submitted to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency’s National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease in Winnipeg and were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. The OIE-World Organisation for Animal Health was notified under international reporting requirements. The results were expected, considering the interaction between infected workers and mink on the farm. Testing to determine genome sequencing and the strain of the virus continues. Results are anticipated soon. H1N2 swine flu case reported in Alberta Under the BC Animal Health Act, the mink farm has been ordered to restrict the transport of animals, products and goods from the farm. Animal welfare is being supported by the Ministry of Agriculture and testing of animals is underway. Enhanced measures are in place to ensure the safety of animals and farm owners. A plan is in place to provide feed and care to the mink during the outbreak. All employers in B.C., including mink farms, are required to implement COVID-19 Safety Plans. This plan includes a requirement to assess the risks to workers and implement measures to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 in the workplace. WorkSafeBC’s Consultation & Education Services team is reaching out directly to other mink farms in B.C. to discuss requirements.

Further advanced investigations of the isolated samples are underway at the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) in Johannesburg, South Africa for verification of the initial results, determine their source and origin, to determine if they are the cause of the paralysis in the three identified children, and to assess if they pose any public health threat, as required by the World Health Organization. “Further laboratory investigations are going on to determine the type of poliovirus we might be dealing with. However, active case finding for any potential AFP cases in the country is continuing, and additional surveillance measures and community actions are ongoing” says Prof. Alpha T. Wurie, Minister of Health and Sanitation. Sierra Leone continues to strengthen its routine immunization levels and disease surveillance, in order to minimize the risk and consequences of any potential polio re-introduction or re-emergence. Sierra Leone has not reported any confirmed polio case since 2010. Elsewhere, Afghanistan reported 54 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases in the past week, bringing the total to 214 this year. The cases were reported from Farah, Khost, Hilmand, Kabul, Kunar, Kunduz, Logar, Paktika, Kandahar, Uruzgan, Wardak and Zabul.

The cases are as follows: One case reported by MOH on December 1 is a 62-year-old man from Riyadh who reported no contact with camels. Then on December 10 , MOH reported two additional cases: A 40-year-old male in Alkhorma city, Taif region who did have contact with camels. And a 53-year-old male in Alahsa city, Alahsa region who also had contact with camels. All three cases reported this month are considered primary cases and none are healthcare workers. Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings. Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and compromised immune systems. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close unprotected contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Got Smallpox?",

In total for 2020, 27 States have recorded at least one confirmed case across 130 Local Government Areas. Of the 241 deaths in confirmed cases, 80 were reported in Ondo state, followed by 40 in Edo state and 23 in Ebonyi state. On the 24th of January 2020, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) declared a Lassa fever outbreak and activated a national Lassa fever Emergency Operations Centre (EOC). In late April, officials declared the emergency phase of the 2020 Lassa fever outbreak over. Got Smallpox? Lassa Fever is an acute viral illness and a viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF). The causative agent is a single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus in the family arenaviridae , the Lassa virus. This zoonotic disease is associated with high morbidity and mortality, transmitted by the multi-mammate rat ( mastomys natalensis ), one of the most common rats in equatorial Africa. The disease was first discovered in a town called Lassa in Borno State, Nigeria in 1969. The actual incidence rate in Nigeria is unknown, but case fatality rates range from 3% to 42% (and over the last two years has remained between 20% and 25%). Historically, outbreaks occur during the dry season (November to April); however, in recent years, cases have also occurred during the rainy season. Lassa fever importation into non-endemic countries has occurred in the UK, USA, and Germany, amongst others. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"a0a96c16200d80a0c15c3f69d4586f36\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B002HRY186,0883490129,1589881222,0393346617\";",

First, health officials reminded the public to refrain from celebrating Christmas and New Year with activities that have higher risks of COVID-19 transmission, including karaoke singing which is a usual Filipino activity during celebrations. PHILIPPINES DOH: STAY AT HOME THIS CHRISTMAS “For a change, let us opt to have a solemn celebration with joyful Christmas songs from our favorite artists played on radios or online music platforms,” Health Secretary Francisco T. Duque said. They also provided suggestions that can help prevent COVID-19 transmissions such as giving face masks and face shields and other creative ways as alternatives to traditional Christmas gifts. How joyous! “When planning for the holiday gift-giving, think of ligtas na regalo – which gifts can make them safe. One thing we recommend are face masks which may serve as a constant reminder to the recipient to wear one,” Sec. Duque said.

Fox said the zoo’s elephant team and veterinary staff from Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine worked tirelessly all week trying to save Batu while the “viral load” of EEHV in his blood grew by the day. Besides aggressive treatment with anti-viral and herpes medicines, the zoo gave Batu infusions of plasma from his adult female herd mate Romani. Several fellow member institutions of the Association of Zoos & Aquariums (AZA) also sent medications to assist in Batu’s treatment. “This is obviously the worst possible outcome, and it occurred after more than a week of intensive care by our team in hopes that every day Batu survived gave him a better chance to beat this horrible disease,” Fox said. EEHV is the most devastating viral disease in elephants worldwide, both in the wild and in human care. It is the biggest killer of young Asian elephants and can cause death within 24 hours in those under age 8. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"cd812aaa46e25b8e46df1cfab74e1e37\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B001HBVPLE,1600789889,B06XJGJ7GM,B07KH8TW9C\";",

        "main_text": "Last year, the Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD) in Las Vegas reported on a gonorrhea case with reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone and cefixime. Today, the Southern Nevada Public Health Laboratory reported in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report ( MMWR ) more details on the case. According to the Notes from the Field , the male urethral gonococcal isolate demonstrated reduced susceptibility to cefixime (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] = 2.0 μ g/mL) and ceftriaxone (MIC = 1.0 μ g/mL) but susceptible to azithromycin (MIC = 0.25 μ g/mL). Molecular testing by CDC in the United States revealed the emerging mosaic penA 60 allele, first identified in Japan in 2016, which confers reduced susceptibility to cephalosporins and increases the risk for treatment failure. This is the first identified case of a Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolate harboring the mosaic penA 60 allele reported in the United States. The patient was empirically treated with the recommended regimen of ceftriaxone (250 mg) given intramuscularly plus azithromycin (1 g) administered orally. He reported at the end of November 2019 that his symptoms had resolved, and further testing returned negative results. The report states: To identify other cases of N. gonorrhoeae with the penA60 allele in the southern Nevada area, in December 2019, SNHD provided CDC with all N. gonorrhoeae NAAT-positive specimens from all SNHD clinics (257 remnant NAATs collected during September 2019–November 2019). Culture-independent molecular testing for the mosaic penA60 allele of the remnant NAATs identified no additional isolates with the mosaic penA60 allele. Approximately 5,500 gonococcal isolates were submitted for testing nationwide as part of GISP during January 2019–December 2019. No other isolates had MICs as high as those for the isolate in the Nevada case (2.0 μg/mL for cefixime and 1.0 μg/mL for ceftriaxone). An advisory was sent to state and local jurisdictions in early 2020; the investigation was stopped in February 2020 because no other isolates of concern had been identified. To date, continued spread of this isolate has not been seen in southern Nevada or GISP. Despite the susceptibility patterns identified in this case, no treatment failures in the United States using the current recommended regimen of ceftriaxone and azithromycin have been reported. In addition to Japan, the penA 60 allele has been identified in China, Canada, Denmark, Australia, France, and the United Kingdom. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"d270e47ac11dd60d0bb83d2b8d5159bf\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B085P2DXHM,B07GFRG49Y,B000JZ08US,B086G6FKRX\";",

        "headline": "FDA issues EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine - Outbreak News Today",
        "main_text": "On Friday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued the first emergency use authorization (EUA) for a vaccine for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 16 years of age and older. The emergency use authorization allows the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to be distributed in the U.S. “The FDA’s authorization for emergency use of the first COVID-19 vaccine is a significant milestone in battling this devastating pandemic that has affected so many families in the United States and around the world,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “Today’s action follows an open and transparent review process that included input from independent scientific and public health experts and a thorough evaluation by the agency’s career scientists to ensure this vaccine met FDA’s rigorous, scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization. The tireless work to develop a new vaccine to prevent this novel, serious, and life-threatening disease in an expedited timeframe after its emergence is a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide.” The FDA has determined that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has met the statutory criteria for issuance of an EUA. The totality of the available data provides clear evidence that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine may be effective in preventing COVID-19. The data also support that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks, supporting the vaccine’s use in millions of people 16 years of age and older, including healthy individuals. In making this determination, the FDA can assure the public and medical community that it has conducted a thorough evaluation of the available safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality information. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine contains messenger RNA (mRNA), which is genetic material. The vaccine contains a small piece of the SARS-CoV-2 virus’s mRNA that instructs cells in the body to make the virus’s distinctive “spike” protein. When a person receives this vaccine, their body produces copies of the spike protein, which does not cause disease, but triggers the immune system to learn to react defensively, producing an immune response against SARS-CoV-2. “While not an FDA approval, today’s emergency use authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine holds the promise to alter the course of this pandemic in the United States,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “With science guiding our decision-making, the available safety and effectiveness data support the authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine because the vaccine’s known and potential benefits clearly outweigh its known and potential risks. The data provided by the sponsor have met the FDA’s expectations as conveyed in our June and October guidance documents. Efforts to speed vaccine development have not sacrificed scientific standards or the integrity of our vaccine evaluation process. The FDA’s review process also included public and independent review from members of the agency’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. Today’s achievement is ultimately a testament to the commitment of our career scientists and physicians, who worked tirelessly to thoroughly evaluate the data and information for this vaccine.” FDA Evaluation of Available Safety Data Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is administered as a series of two doses, three weeks apart. The available safety data to support the EUA include 37,586 of the participants enrolled in an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled international study, the majority of whom are U.S. participants. These participants, 18,801 of whom received the vaccine and 18,785 of whom received saline placebo, were followed for a median of two months after receiving the second dose. The most commonly reported side effects, which typically lasted several days, were pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, and fever. Of note, more people experienced these side effects after the second dose than after the first dose, so it is important for vaccination providers and recipients to expect that there may be some side effects after either dose, but even more so after the second dose. It is mandatory for Pfizer Inc. and vaccination providers to report the following to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine: all vaccine administration errors, serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS), and cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death. FDA Evaluation of Available Effectiveness Data The effectiveness data to support the EUA include an analysis of 36,523 participants in the ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled international study, the majority of whom are U.S. participants, who did not have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection through seven days after the second dose. Among these participants, 18,198 received the vaccine and 18,325 received placebo. The vaccine was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19 disease among these clinical trial participants with eight COVID-19 cases in the vaccine group and 162 in the placebo group. Of these 170 COVID-19 cases, one in the vaccine group and three in the placebo group were classified as severe. At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person. The EUA Process On the basis of the determination by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services on February 4, 2020, that there is a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad, and then issued declarations that  circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of unapproved products, the FDA may issue an EUA to allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent COVID-19 when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. The issuance of an EUA is different than an FDA approval (licensure) of a vaccine. In determining whether to issue an EUA for a product, the FDA evaluates the available evidence and assesses any known or potential risks and any known or potential benefits, and if the benefit-risk assessment is favorable, the product is made available during the emergency. Once a manufacturer submits an EUA request for a COVID-19 vaccine to the FDA, the agency then evaluates the request and determines whether the relevant statutory criteria are met, taking into account the totality of the scientific evidence about the vaccine that is available to the FDA. The EUA also requires that fact sheets that provide important information, including dosing instructions, and information about the benefits and risks of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, be made available to vaccination providers and vaccine recipients. The company has submitted a pharmacovigilance plan to FDA to monitor the safety of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. The pharmacovigilance plan includes a plan to complete longer-term safety follow-up for participants enrolled in ongoing clinical trials. The pharmacovigilance plan also includes other activities aimed at monitoring the safety profile of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and ensuring that any safety concerns are identified and evaluated in a timely manner. The FDA also expects manufacturers whose COVID-19 vaccines are authorized under an EUA to continue their clinical trials to obtain additional safety and effectiveness information and pursue approval (licensure). The EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was issued to Pfizer Inc. The EUA will be effective until the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biologics for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is terminated, and may be revised or revoked if it is determined the EUA no longer meets the statutory criteria for issuance.",

        "headline": "Researchers evaluate face masks and coverings as protection against COVID-19 - Outbreak News Today",
        "main_text": "It’s been shown that when two people wearing masks interact, the chance of COVID-19 transmission is drastically reduced. This is why public health officials have pleaded for all people to wear masks: they not only protect the wearer from expelling particles that might carry SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), but masks also protect the wearer from inhaling particles that carry the virus. Some people, though, still refuse to wear a mask. So UNC School of Medicine scientists, in collaboration with the Environmental Protection Agency, researched the protectiveness of various kinds of consumer-grade and modified masks, assuming the mask wearer was exposed to the virus, like when we interact with an unmasked infected person. Published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine , the research shows that some masks were as much as 79 percent effective at blocking particles that could carry the virus. These were masks made of two layers of woven nylon and fit snug against the wearer’s face. Unmodified medical procedure masks with ear loops – also known as surgical masks – offered 38.5 percent filtration efficacy, but when the ear loops were tied in a specific way to tighten the fit, the efficacy improved to 60.3 percent. And when a layer of nylon was added, these masks offered 80 percent effectiveness. “While modifications to surgical masks can enhance the filtering capabilities and reduce inhalation of airborne particles by improving the fit of the mask, we demonstrated that the fitted filtration efficiencies of many consumer-grade masks were nearly equivalent to or better than surgical masks,” said co-first author Phillip Clapp, PhD, an inhalation toxicologist and assistant professor of pediatrics at the UNC School of Medicine. Co-first author Emily Sickbert-Bennett, PhD, director of infection prevention at the UNC Medical Center, added, “Limiting the amount of virus is important because the more viral particles we’re exposed to, the more likely it is we will get sick and potentially severely ill.” As the adoption of face coverings during the COVID-19 pandemic became commonplace, there was a rapid expansion in the public use of commercial, home-made, and improvised masks which vary considerably in design, material, and construction. There have been a number of innovative “hacks,” devices, and mask enhancements that claim to improve the performance characteristics of conventional masks – typically surgical or procedure masks. Despite their widespread dissemination and use during the pandemic, there have been few evaluations of the efficiency of these face coverings or mask enhancements at filtering airborne particles. In this study, the researchers used a recently described methodological approach based on the OSHA Fit Test to determine the fitted filtration efficiency (FFE) of a variety of consumer-grade and improvised facemasks, as well as several popular modifications of medical procedure masks. Seven consumer-grade masks and five medical procedure mask modifications were fitted on an adult male, and FFE measurements were collected during a series of repeated movements of the torso, head, and facial muscles as outlined by the OSHA Quantitative Fit Testing Protocol. Here are the different mask types with filtration efficacy. Bolded below is the top-of-the-line N-95 mask, which proved to be 98 percent effective. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"d270e47ac11dd60d0bb83d2b8d5159bf\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B08GQZYSWK,B0884VL4ZR,B087LR59CF,B08HZ2X753\"; Consumer-grade facemasks: 2-layer woven nylon mask, ear loops, w/o aluminum nose bridge: 44.7% 2-layer woven nylon mask, ear loops, w/ aluminum nose bridge: 56.7% 2-layer woven nylon mask, ear loops, w/ nose bridge, 1 non-woven insert: 74.4% 2-later woven nylon mask, ear loops, w/ nose bridge, washed, no insert: 79% Cotton bandana – folded Surgeon General style: 50% Cotton bandana – folded “Bandit” style: 49 % Single-layer woven polyester gaiter/neck cover (balaclava bandana): 37.8% Single-layer woven polyester/nylon mask with ties: 39.7% Non-woven polypropylene mask with fixed ear loops: 28.6% Three-layer woven cotton mask with ear loops: 26.5% Medical facemasks and modifications: 3M 9210 NIOSH-approved N95 Respirator: 98% Surgical mask with ties: 71.4% Procedure mask with ear loops: 38.5% Procedure mask with ear loops + “loops tied and corners tucked in”: 60.3% Procedure mask with ear loops + “Ear Guard”: 61.7% Procedure mask with ear loops + “23mm claw hair clip”: 64.8% Procedure mask with ear loops + “Fix-the Mask (3 rubber bands)”: 78.2% Procedure mask with ear loops + “nylon hosiery sleeve”: 80.2%",

The individual had exposure to live chicken at home prior to developing symptoms on November 16. She was hospitalized and subsequently passed away on November 27. From 2014 to date, 25 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by the Chinese health authorities. Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans includes eye infection (conjunctivitis), flu-like symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) or severe respiratory illness (e.g. chest infection). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days. The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and even death. People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient. People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. The elderly, children and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"cd812aaa46e25b8e46df1cfab74e1e37\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B00R92CL5E,B08HCN4MH3,B07N9L5934,B07FW2KT8F\";",

        "main_text": "In a follow-up on the SARS-CoV-2 mink-associated variant strain in Denmark, the Statens Serum Institut (SSI) reports there has been a marked decrease in the number of persons residing on mink farms infected with SARS-CoV-2, while at the same time, the strain is infecting more of society in the general community. According to SSI, the number of new infected persons associated with mink production fell to 28 in week 48 against 138 in week 47. Of the 28 infected, 3 were in the North Jutland Region, 10 in the Central Jutland Region and 12 in the Southern Denmark Region. Finally, there were 3 covid-19 infected with connections to the same mink herd in Region Zealand. Some of the new infected are not associated with covid-19 infected mink herds or mink herds in the killing zone. According to SSI, this means that there may have been SARS-CoV-2 in some of the herds that were not subject to restrictions. “Therefore, there may be breeding animals left on these herds, as well as killed mink for fur that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 at the time they were killed,” says department head Tyra Grove Krause from SSI. She continues: “As a result, staff at the fur series may have been exposed to infection. That could explain why there have been covid-19 outbreaks on six large and two smaller fur series. But that, of course, is just one of several possible causes that are currently being investigated. ” SARS-CoV-2 and mink variant in the community In North Jutland, the number of detected cases of SARS-CoV-2 in society has fallen from 817 in week 44 to 268 in week 48. At the same time, however, the proportion of cases with the mink variant has increased from 17% in week 44 to 31% in week 47. In In the Central Jutland Region, the number of newly detected SARS-CoV-2 cases has fallen slightly from 1,720 new cases in week 47 to 1,528 in week 48. Of these, mink variants accounted for 31% in week 46 and 32% in week 47. In the Region of Southern Denmark, the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases also decreased slightly from 1,454 new cases in week 47 to 1,296 new cases in week 48. Of these, mink variants of SARS-CoV-2 accounted for 11% in week 46 and 21% in week 47. “However, the proportion of mink-related cases of covid-19 is probably underestimated in the region, as there have been examples of infection with new virus types that are not closely related to the mink variant. We do not yet know the extent of these types, because we are currently working to include these in our analyzes, ”says Tyra Grove Krause. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"88da59e22ef4ab1a0d35deeca5242205\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07CP6LRVX,0393346617,1284136744,1119382866\";",

        "main_text": "The researchers have also designed and validated a PCR test that can detect these mutations. “We found that non-coding RNA mutations within the bacterium N. meningitidis are almost twice as likely to be associated with serious meningococcal disease, an uncommon but serious infection that can lead to death,” says Edmund Loh, corresponding author and assistant professor at the Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology at Karolinska Institutet. “This is also the first time a non-coding RNA in a bacterium has been associated with the development of a disease in humans.” N. meningitidis is a bacterium that is often found in the nose of 10 to 15 percent of the human population. In general, the bacteria do not cause any disease. However, when it does, people can become very ill rapidly and die within a few hours if left untreated. The research work began in 2017 after a strain of the N. meningitidis bacterium was isolated from a Swedish teenager who succumbed to meningococcal meningitis. When compared with another strain of the same bacterium isolated from an asymptomatic individual, the researchers discovered mutation in a regulatory non-coding RNA molecule, known as RNA thermosensor, or RNAT, within the strain from the deceased teenager. This finding prompted the researchers to embark on a quest to collect and investigate more than 7,000 RNAT configurations of N. meningitidis from around Europe. In total, the researchers discovered five new variants of RNATs that could be linked to illness, that is they were more likely to appear in individuals who had become ill from the bacterium. These variants shared a common trait in that they produced more and bigger capsules that insulated the bacterium and thus helped it evade the body’s immune system. “This is the first time we have been able to associate an RNAT’s effect on meningitis disease progression,” says the paper’s first author Jens Karlsson, PhD student at the same department. “This supports further research into this and other non-coding RNAs’ potential involvement in the development of bacterial diseases.” As part of the study, the researchers also developed a quick PCR test that is capable of distinguishing these RNAT mutations. “In the future, this PCR test may be coupled with a simple nose swab at a clinic, and in doing so, facilitate a speedy identification of these mutations, and subsequent treatment,” Edmund Loh concludes. The study was funded by the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research, the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation and the Swedish Research Council.

        "headline": "Auckland reports large increase in norovirus outbreaks, Linked to use of improper cleaning products - Outbreak News Today",
        "main_text": "In New Zealand, Auckland health officials are reporting a dramatic increase in norovirus outbreaks, in fact a tenfold increase, in the region’s early learning services (ELSs) in November. Auckland Regional Public Health Service (ARPHS) reports responding to 29 norovirus outbreaks, with 21 of these being in ELS facilities. Around 64 staff and 280 attendees of these ELSs became unwell. Medical Officer of Health Dr Jay Harrower says this is a significant increase on 2019 numbers. “In the same period last year, we responded to a total of nine norovirus outbreaks, with only two of these being in early learning services. Six staff and 29 attendees became ill as a result.” Dr Harrower says ARPHS has identified that some centres with outbreaks have been cleaning with ammonia-based products as these are marketed as inactivating the coronavirus (COVID-19). “There is a common factor in the sharp rise in norovirus outbreaks in Auckland early learning centres over the last two months. Most of the centres with norovirus have moved away from chlorine bleach for cleaning.” He is asking centres to use hypochlorite (chlorine bleach) products for all cleaning, and to use them regularly and thoroughly. “It is hypochlorite or bleach that will kill norovirus on surfaces, and can also prevent the spread of coronavirus as well. Ammonia and alcohol based solutions do not completely inactivate norovirus,” he says. Norovirus symptoms can include feeling or being sick, diarrhoea, stomach cramps, headache, low-grade fever, chills and muscle aches. Symptoms usually last for two days. Good hand hygiene – washing and drying hands thoroughly and often – is the most important action to take in preventing spread of the virus. Norovirus can survive outside the body, so hard surfaces, toys, plates, cutlery and other objects can become contaminated and lead to others becoming ill. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"014a56bca97bf1d177086c9e8970e969\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07GPNZSMY,B086V8RPT6,B07TV1J4KW,B08MQ69T16\";",

The UN agencies say immunization rates in some countries have fallen by as much as 50 per cent, with people unable to access health services because of lockdown and transport disruptions, or unwillingness due to fear of contracting COVID-19. “COVID-19 has had a devastating effect on health services and in particular immunization services, worldwide,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO. This prompted the UN agencies to issue a urgent call to action. They say that if left unchecked, the situation posed an “increasingly high risk of explosive outbreaks and potentially further international spread of both polio and measles.” Michael Osterholm, PhD on lockdowns, masks and COVID-19 testing Henrietta Fore, Executive Director of UNICEF, said that the world “cannot allow” the fight against one deadly disease – COVID-19 – to impact the fight against other diseases. “Addressing the global COVID-19 pandemic is critical. However, other deadly diseases also threaten the lives of millions of children in some of the poorest areas of the world. That is why today we are urgently calling for global action from country leaders, donors and partners,” she said. “We need additional financial resources to safely resume vaccination campaigns and prioritize immunization systems that are critical to protect children and avert other epidemics besides COVID-19.” amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"0b41719676383652c05638524959747b\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"0231186991,006122796X\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";",

As a preventive measure, in the light of the first analysis results obtained by the departmental laboratory of the Landes, the Prefecture ordered the euthanasia of all the ducks on the farm on December 6. The temporary control zone set up around the farm gave way on December 7 to a protection zone (3 km around the outbreak) and a surveillance zone (10 km), in accordance with the regulations. In order to control the risk of spreading the virus, the movement of poultry is prohibited in these areas where strict sanitary measures must be observed.

        "main_text": "In Norway, the Institute of Public Health, or Folkehelseinstituttet reported today monitoring data and modeling show a decrease in the spread of infection over the last three weeks. 2,500 cases have been reported in the week ending December 5, a decrease of 14 per cent compared with the previous week when 2,921 cases were reported. Officials say there is every reason to believe that the decline is due to the overall effect of the measures that have been implemented. However – the situation is still unstable with the danger of a new increase, and it is therefore still important that everyone follows the general infection control advice. There are still large geographical variations–Oslo and Viken had the highest incidence while Rogaland, Trøndelag and Nordland have the lowest incidence. There were 21 deaths reported last week. There is a need for sustained strong efforts to reduce the spread of infection in Oslo and Viken at the same time as municipalities elsewhere in the country must detect and quickly gain control of their outbreaks. Testing and infection tracing is the most important measure to stop outbreaks, but targeted or general contact-reducing measures may be necessary as well. To date, Norway has reported 39,163 total cases, including 361  deaths. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"59ca497f40663a8464454ae64a4c26fd\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B082YW2SZX,B073KTXFLS,B082D74N22,B08DJ3K6QN\";",

        "main_text": "Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE announced today that the Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the U.K. has granted a temporary authorization for emergency use for their COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2), against COVID-19. This constitutes the first Emergency Use Authorization following a worldwide Phase 3 trial of a vaccine to help fight the pandemic. The MHRA says the decision by the UK regulatory authority was made with advice from the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM), the government’s independent expert scientific advisory body. A dedicated team of MHRA scientists and clinicians carried out a rigorous, scientific and detailed review of all the available data, starting in October 2020. This was done using a regulatory process known as a ‘rolling review’. A ‘rolling review’ can be used to complete the assessment of a promising medicine or vaccine during a public health emergency in the shortest time possible. This is done as the packages of data become available from ongoing studies on a staggered basis. The MHRA expert scientists and clinicians reviewed data from the laboratory pre-clinical studies, clinical trials, manufacturing and quality controls, product sampling and testing of the final vaccine and also considered the conditions for its safe supply and distribution. “Today’s Emergency Use Authorization in the U.K. marks a historic moment in the fight against COVID-19. This authorization is a goal we have been working toward since we first declared that science will win, and we applaud the MHRA for their ability to conduct a careful assessment and take timely action to help protect the people of the U.K.,” said Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer. “As we anticipate further authorizations and approvals, we are focused on moving with the same level of urgency to safely supply a high-quality vaccine around the world. With thousands of people becoming infected, every day matters in the collective race to end this devastating pandemic.” “The Emergency Use Authorization in the U.K. will mark the first time citizens outside of the trials will have the opportunity to be immunized against COVID-19,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech. “We believe that the roll-out of the vaccination program in the U.K. will reduce the number of people in the high-risk population being hospitalized. Our aim is to bring a safe and effective vaccine upon approval to the people who need it. The data submitted to regulatory agencies around the world are the result of a scientifically rigorous and highly ethical research and development program.” amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"0e1796eb5421e66103547dcac86cbe62\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"125078445X,0393319806,0761189815,1681883813\";",

        "main_text": "Malaysian health authorities reported two additional human rabies cases in Sarawak province. The first case, the seventh of the year, was a 3-year-old boy with a history of being bitten by a dog on the face on November 2, 2020. He was immediately admitted to Bau Hospital to receive rabies immunoglobulin injection (RIG) and anti-rabies vaccine. The case was discharged in good health on November 6, 2020. However, on November 13, 2020 until November 15, 2020, the child developed high fever, weak limbs, poor appetite, restlessness, hydrophobia and showed aggressive behavior. He was admitted to Sarawak General Hospital (HUS) on 16 November 2020 for further treatment and confirmed to be infected with the rabies virus through laboratory tests conducted by the Institute of Medical Research (IMR) on 25 November 2020. The child is being treated at HUS and in stable condition. The dog confirmed positive for rabies virus on 18 November 2020. The second case, the eighth of the year, a 58-year-old man who was admitted to the ward at Lundu Hospital on 19 November 2020 with symptoms of pain and weakness for three days. He also complained of a sore throat with difficulty eating and drinking. The case was transferred to Sarawak General Hospital on 21 November 2020 when his health condition worsened. He died on 25 November 2020 with a diagnosis of rabies meningoencephalitis. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive laboratory test for rabies by IMR on 25 November 2020. The deceased had a history of being bitten by a wild dog in the last two years while hunting in the jungle. However, he did not seek treatment at any health facility. The case also defended five dogs but the dogs were confirmed negative for rabies by the Sarawak Veterinary Department. With the addition of these two new cases, the total number of rabies cases among humans in Malaysia for the year 2020 is eight cases. The increase in these cases also brings the total number of cases in the rabies epidemic in Sarawak declared on 31 July 2017 to 30 cases with 28 deaths. There are only two surviving cases and both are children with a history of seeking early treatment.",

Individuals became sick between June 2017 and October 2020. Four individuals have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Based on the investigation findings to date, exposure to pet hedgehogs has been identified as the likely source of the outbreak. Many of the individuals who became sick reported having direct or indirect contact with hedgehogs before their illnesses occurred. Ill individuals reported buying hedgehogs from various sources, including pet stores, breeders, or sellers advertising online. The investigation is ongoing to determine if there is a common source of hedgehogs. Canadians are advised to practice good hand hygiene, frequent handwashing and safe handling of hedgehogs and their environments. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is also investigating an outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium illnesses that have a similar genetic fingerprint to illnesses reported in this outbreak.

EFSA reports more than 300 cases have been reported in the past month in a number of countries to include Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The Lithuanian State Food and Veterinary Office (SFVS) says a total of 367 poultry farms have been infected with the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus this year, killing more than 6 million poultry. In its previous overview EFSA warned that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) could spread quickly to western Europe following outbreaks among wild and domestic birds in western Russia and Kazakhstan this summer. The region is on the autumn migration route for wild water birds heading to Europe. According to experts, the most commonly detected type is the H5N8 virus subtype in Europe today. The risk to humans is low and there is also no risk of the virus being transmitted through fresh poultry meat or its products. However, as a precautionary measure, humans should avoid touching sick or dead birds, thus reducing the potential risk of transmission or infection of the virus. Nik Kriz, Head of EFSA’s Animal and Plant Health Unit, said: “Preventing further escalation of these outbreaks will require close cooperation between animal, public, environmental and occupational health authorities – in other words, a One Health approach – across Europe.”",

        "headline": "Argentina hantavirus outbreak linked to 'super-spreader' events: Researchers - Outbreak News Today",
        "main_text": "“Super-spreader” events and extensive person-to-person contact propelled an outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in a small village in Argentina from 2018-2019, according to research published today in The New England Journal of Medicine . In the paper, an international scientific team reports the genetic, clinical, and epidemiologic features of the outbreak caused by the Andes virus, a member of the hantavirus family. The group’s analysis could aid clinicians and public health officials in managing outbreaks of other viral diseases with similar transmission patterns, including COVID-19. Andes virus is carried by wild rodents native to South America, and people can be infected through exposure to infected animals or their droppings. Like other hantaviruses, Andes virus infection can lead to a severe and often fatal respiratory disease in humans, called Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS). Importantly, Andes virus is the only hantavirus known to spread person to person. Those who come into direct contact with an infected individual or their body fluids, or who spend time in close proximity to an ill person, may also become infected. Currently, no licensed vaccines or drugs are available to treat the disease. Animal Viruses and Humans, a Narrow Divide: How Lethal Zoonotic Viruses Spill Over and Threaten Us According to the study, led by scientists at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases ( USAMRIID ) and Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud Dr. Carlos G. Malbran (ANLIS), large social events and high viral load in infected individuals fueled person-to-person transmission of the Andes virus during the outbreak. Researchers teamed up with local health authorities to piece together a near-complete epidemiological “picture” reconstructing specific transmission events for the 34 confirmed cases. They traced the outbreak’s origin to a single spillover event, and documented a 32 percent case fatality rate overall. Argentina: Hantavirus outbreak strain characterized Argentina: Hantavirus outbreak prompts travel alert Argentina: Hantavirus outbreak in Epuyén is ‘unprecedented’ While person-to-person spread of Andes virus was first described in 1996, the recent outbreak had the most extensive recorded human-to-human transmission of the virus seen to date. The team’s genomic analysis showed a striking similarity between the 2018-2019 and 1996 outbreak sequences. Understanding which genomic “signatures” correspond to the mechanisms necessary for person-to-person transmission may help scientists to develop new therapeutics to treat Andes virus infection. Researchers found that droplets or aerosolized viral particles may have been routes of infection during the extensive person-to-person transmission of the 2018-2019 outbreak. They also noted that symptoms presented anywhere between 9 and 40 days after the infection took place. However, the authors pointed out that there might be a narrow window of infectiousness. Transmission often occurred on the first day of fever presentation in an infected patient. Interestingly, there was no clear association between the individuals transmitting the virus and their disease severity. “This important observation indicates that, regardless of the severity of the disease, all HPS cases should be equally managed concerning their potential for virus transmission,” said Gustavo Palacios, Ph.D., co-senior author of the paper and Division Chief of Molecular Biology at USAMRIID. “Furthermore, we need to re-evaluate the threat that this virus poses. The lack of existing medical countermeasures, super-spreading potential, and high case-fatality rate all should raise concern.” Hantavirus alert issued in Chubut province, Argentina These findings could potentially help clinicians and public health officials deal with future outbreaks. As with the preventive measures currently being practiced for COVID-19, social distancing and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment were effective in controlling transmission. Moreover, widespread contact tracing and self-quarantining led to a detectable decrease in transmission. “Although less than 10 percent of cases occurred in hospital settings, the threat to clinicians and hospital staff must not be underestimated,” said Valeria Martinez, Ph.D., of ANLIS, co-first author of the study. “Doctors should remember that in the 1996 outbreak, many health care personnel got sick, and some died, when the appropriate personal protective equipment was not used.” According to the authors, the study also examined cytokines within patients to determine the types of immunological responses present in people with HPS caused by Andes virus. Cytokines are proteins that aid cell-to-cell communication in immune responses. They concluded that there was no clear mechanism, but more of a broad and dysfunctional immunologic response among patients. “We hope that by further exploring this apparent immune dysregulation, we will expand our knowledge of how different hantavirus species cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome,” said co-author Mariano Sanchez-Lockhart, Ph.D., of USAMRIID. “Gaining a better understanding of how our immune system tackles Andes virus infection will certainly help clinicians to better manage severe cases and pave the way for new therapeutic interventions.” Based on their comprehensive data, the team confirmed the necessity to study the patterns of Andes virus emergence, super-spreading, person-to-person transmission, and pathology to improve public health response strategies. “The breadth of techniques and expertise used to piece together person-to-person transmission and super-spreading events could be applied beyond Andes virus outbreaks,” said co-author Peter Larson, Ph.D., of USAMRIID. “We hope this approach serves as a model for future investigations of person-to-person transmission and for the identification of super-spreading events.” According to Palacios, the investigative foundation for this work was built and tested by USAMRIID’s Center for Genome Sciences during outbreaks of Ebola virus disease in Western Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as the introduction of Zika virus into the United States. “While we are proud of this work and our track record, we believe this is only the beginning,” said Palacios. “Having a comprehensive approach to track spillover events is a long-term goal we strive for every day.”",

        "main_text": "Through the first nearly 10 months of 2020, health officials have reported 6,231 suspected and confirmed monkeypox cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Cases have been reported in 127 health zones from 17 out of 26 provinces in the country. This is a large increase in cases compared to the same period in 2019 when 4,311 cases were reported. In addition, the death toll due to monkeypox has topped 200–203 reported year to date, more than doubling the 87 deaths recorded last year through October. Officials say one major challenge to the current emergency includes acquiring the required funding to respond to all the multiple ongoing outbreaks in the country. Infected animals such as rodents and primates can spread the virus to people (or other animals) when they bite or scratch. A person can also become infected by touching infected animals or from touching products that come from infected animals, including meat. People infected with monkeypox can spread the virus to others through the air when they cough, sneeze, or talk. The body fluids and skin sores of a person infected with monkeypox are also infectious. Outbreak News Merchandise Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by a virus. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, and exhaustion are followed by a rash. Patients are usually ill for 2–4 weeks. Monkeypox is fatal in as many as 10% of people who get it. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"0e1796eb5421e66103547dcac86cbe62\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"125078445X,0393319806,0761189815,1681883813\";",

Initially, when the first vaccine doses arrive in Sweden, they first and foremost need to go to people who have the greatest need for protection. The Swedish Public Health Agency therefore recommends in the agency’s second sub-report that the following groups be offered vaccination first – and in the following order of priority if volumes are limited: In total, about 600,000 people are included in these mainly priority groups. The recommendation will be updated and adapted based on the situation regarding the disease burden and the spread of infection in society. Which vaccines are approved for use, and which groups they are approved for and recommended for, will also be considered. The Swedish Public Health Agency’s recommendation is support for the regions’ own decisions on vaccination, and a basis for them to be able to make decisions according to different conditions. It is the regions that are responsible for the vaccinations being carried out when an approved vaccine is available. It is expected to take place sometime in January 2021, or earlier depending on when the vaccine is approved and when vaccination can be performed according to plan. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"03a8666134eb6300fa6c720f6c91d8c5\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07GPNZSMY,B086V8RPT6,B08D3BS7DR,B0863CG57T\";",

In 2020, this number had a significant drop, with 4,339 cases and also no deaths. That’s because the world is going through the new coronavirus pandemic. SES spokesman Alexandre Chieppe explains the drop in cases this year. Aedes aegypti mosquito “SES expected, based on the data collected in 2019, mainly due to the re-entry of dengue virus 2 (virus that had circulated in Rio de Janeiro in the years 2007 to 2009), that there would be an increase in cases, because a part significant number of the population is susceptible to this type of virus. But it was not what we observed. We have not confirmed any deaths from dengue in 2020, so far, in the state of Rio “, says Chieppe. “In fact, the number of cases was much lower than in 2019.

All 10,500 birds at the farm will be humanely culled to limit the spread of the disease. A 3km and 10km Temporary Control Zone has been put in place around the infected site to limit the risk of the disease spreading. Public Health England (PHE) advises that the risk to public health from the virus is very low and the Food Standards Agency advises that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat. Chief Veterinary Officer, Christine Middlemiss, said: Bird keepers should remain alert for any signs of disease, report suspected disease immediately and ensure they are maintaining good biosecurity on their premises. Dr Gavin Dabrera, Consultant in Acute Respiratory Infections at PHE said: A detailed investigation is in progress to determine the most likely source of this outbreak. There is not anticipated to be any impact on the supplies of turkeys or other birds over Christmas. Wild birds migrating from mainland Europe during the winter period can spread the disease to poultry and other captive birds.

This virus has caused outbreaks among birds in several European countries this autumn. The virus can cause serious illness in birds, but has not been detected in humans. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority is following up the incident. During this autumn, several outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N8) have been seen in wild birds and poultry in Europe. The infection has also been detected in wild birds and poultry in Denmark and on a turkey farm in Scania in Sweden earlier in November. On 27 November, the Veterinary Institute announced the discovery of the virus in a dead wild goose found in Rogaland. This is the first time that highly pathogenic bird flu has been detected in Norway. Avian influenza A (H5N8) is highly pathogenic (highly pathogenic) to birds, but is not associated with human disease. The consequences of any infection from wild birds to poultry can be serious for the poultry industry. A similar virus has caused major outbreaks in birds in Europe also in previous years, without cases of infection from birds to humans being detected, says doctor Trine Hessevik Paulsen. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health considers the risk of infection to humans to be very low. The veterinary authorities are responsible for following up and handling the incident. We closely monitor the situation and cooperate with the Norwegian Food Safety Authority and the Veterinary Institute. The National Institute of Public Health assists, among other things, with advice on infection control for humans, says Paulsen. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority has today issued information on how to prevent infection from wild birds to domestic birds. In addition, the veterinary authorities encourage the public to notify the Norwegian Food Safety Authority of the discovery of weakened and dead birds. For general infection control reasons, one should always avoid touching sick and dead birds, says Paulsen.",

        "main_text": "New Zealand health officials report six members of the Pakistan men’s cricket team have tested positive for COVID-19 at their managed isolation facility at the Chateau on the Park in Christchurch. All members of the team returned a negative COVID-19 test and passed a symptom check before departing Lahore. Fifty-three members of the squad arrived in Christchurch on 24 November and were tested on day 1. These cases are the results of those tests. All cases are being moved to quarantine rooms within the facility. Members of the team will be tested a minimum of four times while in managed isolation. As a result of these positive tests, members of the team will not be able to leave the facility to train. Any training is conditional on a public health assessment, so at this time, no training will be able to take place. The Medical Officer of Health at Canterbury District Health Board has sent a letter to the squad’s management to be communicated to the whole team, reinforcing that all team members are required to stay in their rooms until advised otherwise. In addition, since their arrival, several team members have been seen on CCTV at the facility breaching managed isolation rules, despite clear, consistent and detailed communication of expected behaviours while in the facility. The team as a whole has been issued with a final warning. It’s important to note that all incidents of breaches occurred within the facility and there is no risk to the public. Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said any breaches of managed isolation rules were taken very seriously. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"03d047a2bfb7ebc5a0741533cdf1423f\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07BJ2TWQJ,0857200747\"; “It is a privilege to come to New Zealand to play sport, but in return teams must stick to the rules that are designed to keep COVID-19 out of our communities and keep our staff safe.” Air Commodore Darryn Webb, head of Managed Isolation and Quarantine, said there are robust processes in place in managed isolation facilities to respond to these events. “Our focus is on keeping the rest of the squad and our staff safe. For that reason, all other team members must remain in their rooms while investigations continue. This is in line with standard operating procedures at managed isolation facilities.”",

In 2014, more than 1,600 cases were reported as worldwide numbers also increased. In 2015, the number of syphilis cases topped 2,000, a four-fold increase from just five years earlier. In 2016, Japan saw a 77 percent increase from 2015, topping 4,000 cases–and up by more than seven-fold from a decade ago. 2017, 2018 and 2019 saw more than 5,000 cases and 6,000 cases and once again in 2020, Japan’s National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Tokyo (NIID) have reported that syphilis cases topped 5,000 for the fourth year in a row. According to the latest data from NIID, 5,023 cases have been reported through Nov. 18. Tokyo has seen 1,318 cases, followed by 792 cases in Osaka. Syphilis, “baidoku” in Japanese, is a sexually transmitted infection that is spread by direct, skin to skin contact during unprotected sex. Pregnant women who are infected can transmit it to their unborn babies.

        "main_text": "California state health officials are reporting an increase in disseminated gonococcal infections (DGI), which is an uncommon, but significant complication of untreated gonorrhea. Disseminated Gonorrhea Infections occur when the sexually transmitted pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae spreads beyond the site of infection and invades the bloodstream traveling to distant sites in the body. This can lead to  joint pain and swelling from infected joints; small, painless red based skin lesions that have clear fluid or pus in them; infection in the blood; or, on rare occasions, infections of the heart valves or fluid around the brain. Most of the cases in California have presented with joint pain and infected joints. Anyone showing symptoms should immediately reach out to their health care provider. “As an infectious disease and public health physician, I am very concerned that we are seeing completely preventable complications of sexually transmitted disease (STD) infections that went undiagnosed and untreated, likely due to people not seeking care or getting routine testing during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Dr. Erica Pan, Acting State Public Health Officer. “STD risk has not gone away. There are a few groups we especially want to remind to seek STD screening. If you are a sexually active female 25 years of age or younger, if you are pregnant, if you are a man who has sex with men, or if you are living with HIV, please contact your healthcare provider to get recommended testing for STDs.” amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"9b27718be6cb179e82542d17d7861c3e\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B009LRVC0K,B07B2VYWBJ,B07GFRG49Y,B005IG9SW2\";",

The victim is a 16-year-old girl who was admitted to Sarawak General Hospital on November 10 with a fever for three days, was weak in the lower limbs and showed aggressive behavior. She also suffered from aerophobia and hydrophobia. She died the next day. She was diagnosed with rabies encephalitis. Investigations have found no history of dog or other animal bites occurring in this case. The case only had a scratch mark that had healed on the right leg but her family members could not give details about it. She has kept four cats and one dog. All of his pets have never been vaccinated but until now, the pets are in good health and there has been no change in behavior. This is the sixth human rabies case in Sarawak in 2020 and the 28th since the rabies epidemic was declared in Sarawak on 31 July 2017. Rabies is an acute viral infection that is transmitted to humans or other mammals usually through the saliva from a bite of an infected animal. It is also rarely contracted through breaks in the skin or contact with mucous membranes. What to do if you are exposed? See the podcast below:",

        "headline": "Influenza drug, Xofluza, receives expanded approval - Outbreak News Today",
        "main_text": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today expanded the approved indication for Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil) to include post-exposure prevention of influenza (flu) for patients 12 years of age and older after contact with an individual who has the flu. Xofluza, previously available only in tablet form, is also now available as granules for mixing in water. Xofluza was originally approved in 2018 for treating uncomplicated flu in patients 12 years of age and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours. “This expanded indication for Xofluza will provide an important option to help prevent influenza just in time for a flu season that is anticipated to be unlike any other because it will coincide with the coronavirus pandemic,” said Debra Birnkrant, M.D., director of the Division of Antiviral Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Americans will have to be more vigilant than ever as these viruses spread concurrently.” Flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. Treating flu patients with antiviral drugs within 48 hours of their becoming sick can reduce symptoms and duration of the illness. An annual seasonal flu vaccine is the best way to protect against the flu. Xofluza’s safety and efficacy for post-flu exposure prevention is supported by one randomized, double-blind, controlled trial in which 607 subjects, 12 years of age and older who were exposed to a person with influenza in their household, received either a single dose of Xofluza or a single dose of a placebo. Of these 607 subjects, 303 received Xofluza and 304 received the placebo. The trial’s primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who were infected with influenza virus and presented with fever and at least one respiratory symptom from day 1 to day 10. Of those who received Xofluza, 1% of subjects met these criteria, compared to 13% of subjects who received a placebo for the clinical trial. Flu drug, Xofluza, approved for people at high risk of serious flu complications The most common side effects of Xofluza include diarrhea, bronchitis, nausea, sinusitis and headache. Hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis (allergic reaction), can occur in patients taking Xofluza. Patients should not take Xofluza if they have had a known hypersensitivity reaction to Xofluza. Xofluza should not be co-administered with dairy products, calcium-fortified beverages, or laxatives, antacids, or oral supplements containing calcium, iron, magnesium, selenium, aluminum or zinc.

        "main_text": "The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (DPH) has confirmed 51 new deaths and 3,692 new cases of COVID-19 Tuesday. This is the highest number of deaths reported since September 9. COVID-19 hospitalizations continue to accelerate at alarming speed. There are 1,575 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 26% of these people are in the ICU. Just two weeks ago, there were 888 people with COVID-19 hospitalized. The increases in cases and hospitalizations must slow to avoid overwhelming our hospitals and healthcare staff, and save lives, officials said. DPH says everyone should stay home as much as possible and limit going out to what is essential for the next two to three weeks to slow the surging cases and save lives. Staying home as much as possible, always wearing face covering securely over your nose and mouth when out and avoiding being near anyone not in your household are the simple actions that slow the spread of COVID-19. Given the huge surge in cases nationwide, we strongly recommend that you only celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday with people from your household and that you not gather with people from outside your household, even outdoors. Please don’t plan, host or attend holiday gatherings for multiple households. Instead connect virtually together. In addition, Mayor Eric Garcetti announced yesterday that all travelers entering the City from another state or country will be required to fill out an online form to acknowledge and spread awareness of California’s recommended 14-day quarantine upon arrival. Starting Wednesday, passengers arriving at LAX and Van Nuys Airport will see signs and messages reminding them to fill out the required form. “COVID-19 is more dangerous than ever — and from LAX to our businesses to our homes, we have to take action to protect Angelenos and stop the spread of this virus,” said Mayor Eric Garcetti. “Our new form delivers a clear message: if you travel to our city, we want you to be informed of guidelines that will save lives and keep all of us healthy and safe.” To date, DPH identified 374,134 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of L.A. County and a total of 7,497 deaths.",

        "main_text": "In a follow-up on the Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak in the African country of Mauritania, between September 4 to November 7, a total of 214 people were sampled and their samples have been sent to the National Institute for Public Health Research (INRSP) for laboratory testing with a total of 75 testing positive for RVF (RT-PCR and serology by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Positive cases have been reported in 11 of 15 regions of the country: Brakna, Trarza, Gorgol, (on the border with Senegal), Adrar, Assaba, Hodh El Gharby, Hodh El Chargui, Guidimaka (on the border with Mali) and Nouakchott Sud, Nouakchott Ouest and Tagant. The Tagant region is the most affected (38/75, 51%) with principal hotspot districts being Tidjikja and Moudjeria. Thus far a total of 25 deaths have been reported from this outbreak. Outbreaks in animals have also been confirmed in the regions of Assaba, Tagant, Brakna, Trarza, Hodh El Gharbi and Hodh El Chargui. The results of 557 animal samples taken as of 15 October 2020 showed that 74 camels, 52 small ruminants and 12 cattle were positive for Rift Valley Fever. RVF outbreaks have been reported previously in Mauritania, and the country has experienced six major outbreaks in the past (1987, 1998, 2003, 2010, 2012 and 2015) affecting several departments in the regions of Brakna, Tagant, Assaba, Adrar, Inchiri, Trarza, Hodh Elgharby and Hodh El Chargui. The current outbreak affecting human and animals occurred after heavy, unusual and prolonged rainfall in the regions with high animal density which contributed to the proliferation of vectors and the spread of the virus. During hot seasons, people spend more time in rural areas with history of RVF transmission, resting at night in the open air. This could be a risk factor for exposure to mosquitoes and others vector of the disease. It is likely that the season change from November to February (temperate season) could limit the transmission of the disease with the due the reduction of the proliferation of mosquitoes. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"39dee3b832afb86ba0501e4037812200\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B00GGY85EC,B07WVT6Y7F,B01ICAU41E,B0094JTZOU\";",

This is a drop in cases from the week prior when the NCDC reported 11 confirmed cases. The case fatality rate hovers around 20 percent for the year. On the 24th of January 2020, NCDC declared a Lassa fever outbreak and activated a national Lassa fever Emergency Operations Centre (EOC). In late April, officials declared the emergency phase of the 2020 Lassa fever outbreak over. Lassa Fever is an acute viral illness and a viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF). The causative agent is a single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus in the family arenaviridae , the Lassa virus. This zoonotic disease is associated with high morbidity and mortality, transmitted by the multi-mammate rat ( mastomys natalensis ), one of the most common rats in equatorial Africa. The disease was first discovered in a town called Lassa in Borno State, Nigeria in 1969. The actual incidence rate in Nigeria is unknown, but case fatality rates range from 3% to 42% (and over the last two years has remained between 20% and 25%). Historically, outbreaks occur during the dry season (November to April); however, in recent years, cases have also occurred during the rainy season. Lassa fever importation into non-endemic countries has occurred in the UK, USA, and Germany, amongst others.

        "headline": "COVID-19 unexpected consequence: Major measles outbreaks will likely occur during 2021 according to article - Outbreak News Today",
        "main_text": "A new article in The Lancet has called for urgent international action to prevent potentially devastating measles epidemics in the coming years. Lead author Professor Kim Mulholland, from the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute and Chair of the World Health Organization’s SAGE Working Group on measles and rubella vaccines, said that many children have missed out on measles vaccination this year, making future measles outbreaks inevitable. Professor Mulholland said while 2020 had been a quiet year for measles, in part due to travel reductions and national COVID-19 control measures, the economic impacts would lead to many cases of childhood malnutrition. Malnutrition worsens the severity of measles, leading to poorer outcomes and more deaths, especially in low- and middle-income countries. “Children who die from measles are often malnourished, but acute measles pushes many surviving children into malnutrition,” he said. “Malnutrition, along with measles-associated immune suppression, leads to delayed mortality, while co-existing vitamin A deficiency can also lead to measles-associated blindness. “The coming months are likely to see increasing numbers of unimmunised children who are susceptible to measles. Many live in poor, remote communities where health systems are less resilient, and malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency are already increasing.” Professor Mulholland said the COVID-19 pandemic had also had a profound effect on the control of vaccine preventable diseases, with vaccination campaigns paused in the early months of 2020 and routine immunisation services greatly disrupted in many countries. The WHO estimates that by the end of October, 2020, delayed vaccination campaigns in 26 countries have led to 94 million children missing scheduled measles vaccine doses. “All these factors create the environment for severe measles outbreaks in 2021, accompanied by increased death rates and the serious consequences of measles that were common decades ago,” Professor Mulholland said. “This is despite the fact that we have a highly cost effective way to prevent this disease through measles vaccination.” In 2019, before the pandemic started, the world experienced a dramatic return of measles, more than at any time in the past 20 years. WHO data indicates that there were 9.8 million measles cases and 207,000 deaths in 2019, 50 per cent more than in 2016. Most measles deaths in 2019 have been in Africa, many associated with major outbreaks in Madagascar and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Measles also re-emerged in South America, especially among Indigenous communities. “The inadequate vaccination that led to the 2019 measles outbreaks has still not been adequately addressed, and the situation is now exacerbated by service disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic so that high-risk, unimmunised children are clustered together in unreached communities,” Professor Mulholland said. The article has identified three pillars for immediate action: Professor Mulholland said the solutions would help end the cycle of inadequate immunisation and outbreaks of the past decade. “Without concerted efforts now, it is likely that the coming years will see an increase in measles and its severe, frequently fatal, complications,” he said.",

        "main_text": "The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) STD Epidemiology program is reporting a significant increase in the number of reported gonorrhea infections across the state, based on analyses. In 2019, Michigan reported 18,264 gonorrhea infections. This annual number has already been surpassed as of Oct. 31, pointing to a 22% increase in reported gonorrhea infections for 2020. This increase is even more alarming as it is likely an underestimate of the actual burden of disease due to decreased testing for STDs during the pandemic. While under normal circumstances the response to such an increase would include a call for broader testing, there is a national shortage of collection kits and laboratory supplies used to test for gonorrhea. “A shortage of testing supplies during a significant statewide increase in cases presents an alarming potential for a host of negative health outcomes for Michiganders,” said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, chief medical executive and chief deputy for health for MDHHS. “Because laboratory testing is challenging at this time, it is imperative that medical providers continue to clinically diagnose and treat suspected cases of gonorrhea to slow the spread in our state.” Subscribe to Outbreak News TV on YouTube Critical to the current gonorrhea increase and supply shortage, and because of pressure on the public health system, CDC and MDHHS urge providers to evaluate and treat patients presenting with signs or symptoms of infection, regardless of laboratory confirmation.",

The report to the the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) noted that the two outbreaks occurred in the villages of Khantharath and Nakhoysao. More than 500 birds died in the two villages due to the virus. WHO Follow-up on human case In a f ollow-up on the confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) in Saravane province, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports: The case is a one-year-old female who developed symptoms of fever, productive cough, difficulty breathing and runny nose on 13 October 2020. She was hospitalized for her illness on 16 October and discharged on 19 October. As part of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) sentinel surveillance, a specimen was collected on the date of hospitalization and confirmed to be positive for avian influenza A(H5N1) on 28 October by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the National Centre for Laboratory and Epidemiology (NCLE). This is the third human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus reported from Lao PDR since 2005; two cases including two deaths were reported in 2007.

Typhoons Rolly and Ulysses caused widespread flooding and destruction that prompted evacuation in several parts of Luzon. Recognizing the health hazards present in the affected areas, the DOH has alerted its Centers for Health Development to continuously monitor the possible spread of W.I.L.D. diseases, together with concerned Local Government Units (LGUs) and their respective communities. Ayoko sa Lamok: Filipino youth’s battle against dengue fever “We are very wary of possible outbreak of communicable, waterborne and vector-borne diseases after disasters”, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said. COVID-19: Philippines cautioned of possible spike post typhoons According to DOH’s epidemiological analysis, influenza season in the country peaks in July and October, coinciding with the onset of the rainy season as the weather transitions from increased heat and high humidity in the summer to the wet and damp weather conditions. Meanwhile, the stagnant water due to flooding is a good habitat condition for mosquitoes. These floodwaters may also contain leptospira bacteria which causes leptospirosis. DOH likewise notes that the interruption of safe water supply and sanitation due to flooding may cause water and food contamination which bring other diseases such as cholera, typhoid fever, dysentery, amoebiasis, hepatitis A and acute gastroenteritis.

The case involves a one-year-old girl from Salavan, aka Saravane province, in the south of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Laos). She became sick on Oct. 13 and has since recovered and been discharged. She had a history of poultry exposure or live poultry near her home before the onset of disease. The last human H5N1 avian flu case was reported in Nepal in May 2019. A total of 862 cases of H5N1 influenza have been notified in 17 countries worldwide since 2003. Egypt, Indonesia, and Vietnam have been notified as the most countries. So far, a total of 455 cases have died, with a fatality rate of 52.8%. China reports 7th human H9N2 avian influenza case of 2020 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), H5N1 is a type of influenza virus that causes a highly infectious, severe respiratory disease in birds called avian influenza (or “bird flu”). Human cases of H5N1 avian influenza occur occasionally, but it is difficult to transmit the infection from person to person. When people do become infected, the mortality rate is about 60%. Almost all cases of H5N1 infection in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments. The virus does not infect humans easily, and spread from person to person appears to be unusual.

        "main_text": "On Friday, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and state public health officials announced the state of New Mexico will temporarily re-enact a statewide order closing in-person services for all non-essential activities in order to blunt the unprecedented spike of COVID-19 illnesses and to attempt to relieve dramatically escalating strain on hospitals and health care providers across the state. The heightened restrictions statewide, enacted through an amended emergency public health order issued by the state Department of Health, will be in effect for two weeks. The restrictions are effective Monday, Nov. 16, through Monday, Nov. 30. New Mexicans are instructed to stay at home except for only those trips that are essential to health, safety and welfare – such as for food and water, emergency medical care, to obtain a flu shot or to obtain a test for COVID-19. “ The rate of spread and the emergency within our state hospitals are clear indicators that we cannot sustain the current situation without significant interventions to modify individual behavior, ” said Gov. Lujan Grisham. “ We had hoped targeted crackdowns, limited hours of operation and amplified messaging and enforcement would make the difference and slow the spread and relieve our hospitals. The public health data make clear, however, that more aggressive restrictions are not only warranted but essential if we are to prevent mass casualties. “These warnings are intended to inform, not alarm. There are simple steps each of us can and must take. Stay at home. Wear your mask if you must go out. Do not gather with non-household members. Wash or sanitize your hands frequently. Make plans for a different kind of Thanksgiving – one without non-household members.” New Mexico state health officials on Friday announced 1,237 additional COVID-19 cases, bringing the state total to 62,006. Bernalillo County (15,864) and Doña Ana County (9,490) have seen the most cases.

        "main_text": "Children still make up a small proportion of the reported COVID-19 cases in Sweden. A new report shows that primary school teachers, preschool teachers and childminders who meet larger groups of children do not have a higher risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19 compared with other occupational groups. The information is presented in two new reports from the Swedish Public Health Agency, Covid-19 in children and adolescents – a compilation of knowledge and Presence of covid-19 in different occupational groups within the school . The Swedish Public Health Agency closely monitors the state of knowledge and epidemiological developments in Sweden and internationally. The latest scientific knowledge confirms that infectivity between children is significantly lower than between adults. In Sweden, children up to the age of 19 continue to make up a relatively small proportion of the established covid-19 cases, 6.7 per cent. – In general, children get milder symptoms than adults, they rarely constitute the first case in a chain of infection and are not a driving force in the covid-19 pandemic, says department head Britta Björkholm. Adolescents transmit the infection more than children and get more symptoms, but probably to a lesser extent than adults. The school itself does not seem to constitute a risk environment and a number of measures have been taken to reduce the risks of the spread of infection in school environments. On the other hand, it is important to remember that the school is a workplace and in many cases the spread of infection takes place between staff. The employer has a great responsibility to take measures that reduce the risk of infection spreading. Everyone also has their own responsibility to stay at home when they are ill, have good hand hygiene and keep their distance in coffee rooms, work rooms and other common areas, says state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell. It is important that the schools continue to be open. Globally, there are also no indications that schools would constitute a risk environment. However, school closures have had a negative impact on learning and children’s mental and physical health. Already vulnerable children have been hit the hardest. Data that the Swedish Public Health Agency has produced by linking data on covid cases with Statistics Sweden’s register for occupational classification, also shows that preschool teachers, childminders and primary school teachers do not have a higher risk of being diagnosed with covid-19 compared with other occupational groups. On the other hand, there was a relatively higher risk of covid-19 among study and career counselors, principals for preschool, and principals for primary and secondary school. The results show that school and contact with groups of children do not constitute a special risk environment for the spread of infection. However, the differences between the different occupational groups can be due to several different things, such as how many and close contacts you have in your professional role and what activities you engage in in your free time, says Anders Tegnell.",

National Policy against COVID-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar, Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said the government expects a reasonable increase of Covid-19 cases as physical distancing in some evacuation centers might “difficult to be observed” making the virus transmission more possible. Galvez urged the public not to be complacent and keep safe against the risks of Covid-19 infection. He said people should not forget to “at least wear a face mask at all times.” In a situation report, the Department of Health (DOH) reported that majority of its retained hospitals in the National Capital Region (NCR) are fully functional and operational after the onslaught of Typhoon Ulysses.

        "main_text": "Public Health – Seattle & King County reports investigating a new confirmed measles case in a King County male child. The infection was likely acquired while traveling outside the United States. Health officials there are possible public exposures at Sea-Tac Airport. Transmission of measles can occur before people know they have the disease, before any rash appears. Before the measles diagnosis was made, the child was in the following public locations: These times include the period when the individual was at the location and two hours after. Measles virus can remain in the air for up to two hours after someone infectious with measles leaves the area. Anyone who was at these locations during the times listed could have been exposed to measles. “Measles outbreaks continue to circulate in many areas of the world. As long as people travel, no community is safe from measles introductions,” said Jeff Duchin, Health Officer for Public Health – Seattle & King County. “Measles vaccine is safe, effective, and offers excellent protection. If you aren’t sure if you’re up to date with the recommended doses of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR), see your health care provider and get a dose of MMR if needed. “During our COVID-19 pandemic, it’s important to stay up-to-date on all scheduled vaccinations for children, so we don’t lose important community protections against other serious infections.” Anyone who was in the locations of potential exposure to measles around the times listed below should: · Find out if you have been vaccinated for measles or have had measles previously. Make sure you are up-to-date with the recommended number of measles (MMR) vaccinations. · Call a healthcare provider promptly if you develop an illness with fever or illness with an unexplained rash. To avoid possibly spreading measles to others, do not go to a clinic or hospital without calling first to tell them you want to be evaluated for measles. · Vaccination or medication can be given after exposure in some cases to prevent illness – check with your healthcare provider. This is especially important for people at high risk for measles complications. Everyone should stay up-to-date with measles and other routine vaccinations during the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, to keep our community protected against other serious infections. Measles symptoms could appear starting from seven days after the first exposure to twenty-one days after the last exposure to someone with measles. Rash is most likely to appear a few days after the fever, ten to twelve days after an exposure. This is the 13th measles case reported in the US in 2020 to date. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"8cea88540190dc28be8da0b271369cee\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"1421426609,1421440385\";",

        "headline": "Global measles cases hit 23-year high in 2019, Deaths rise 50% in recent years - Outbreak News Today",
        "main_text": "In a joint World Health Organization (WHO) and US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) report Friday , the number of measles cases climb to a global total of 869,770, the highest number of cases for 23 years. Global measles deaths climbed nearly 50 percent since 2016, claiming an estimated 207,500 lives in 2019 alone. Countries that have recently suffered large measles outbreaks include the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Madagascar, Central African Republic (CAR), Georgia, Kazakhstan, North Macedonia, Samoa, Tonga, and Ukraine. The authors of the report cite a failure to vaccinate children on time with two doses of measles-containing vaccines (MCV1 and MCV2) as the main driver of these increases in cases and deaths. In 2020, there have been fewer cases, but the COVID-19 pandemic has further set back vaccination efforts, with more than 94 million people at risk of missing measles vaccines in 26 countries that have paused their vaccination campaigns, including many countries with ongoing outbreaks. “Before there was a coronavirus crisis, the world was grappling with a measles crisis, and it has not gone away”, Henrietta Fore, UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Executive Director, said in a statement. “While health systems are strained by the COVID-19 pandemic, we must not allow our fight against one deadly disease to come at the expense of our fight against another.” Measles outbreaks occur when people who are not protected from the virus are infected and spread the disease to unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. To control measles and prevent outbreaks and deaths, vaccination coverage rates with the required MCV1 and MCV2 must reach 95 percent and be maintained at national and subnational levels.  MCV1 coverage has been stagnant globally for more than a decade at between 84 and 85 percent. MCV2 coverage has been steadily increasing but is only now at 71 percent. Vaccination coverage against measles remains well below the 95 percent or higher needed with both doses to control measles and prevent outbreaks and deaths. During 2000–2019, compared with no measles vaccination, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 25.5 million deaths globally. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"5d15de98410fb484ef5632cf0bf47a20\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"1421426609,1421440385,0231186991,0465057969\";",

        "main_text": "The Chile Ministry of Health reported 1,597 new cases of COVID-19 in the country with 6 regions that saw their new cases decrease in the last 7 days and 11 regions in the last 14 days. The rate of PCR positivity in the Metropolitan Region remains low, at 2%, while the degree of occupancy of ICU beds due to COVID-19 is stabilized at 38%. “Regardless of whether the commune is in quarantine or advancing in the Step by Step Plan the people must maintain preventive measures against COVID-19 “, said the Minister of Health, Enrique Paris. The minister reported that the regions with the highest increase in new confirmed cases in the last 7 days are: Atacama, Ñuble, Tarapacá and Los Ríos. Of the 1,597 new cases of COVID-19, 545 are asymptomatic people and 1,029 of  those who have presented with symptoms. The total number of people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the country has reached 531,273. 14,819 deaths have been recorded. On Friday, the Undersecretary of the Interior, Juan Francisco Galli, together with the Undersecretary of Public Health, Paula Daza, announced the Step-by-Step Border Opening Plan, which includes three fundamental pillars: gradualness, security and traceability. As of November 23 at 00:00, foreigners may enter the country only through the Arturo Merino Benítez airport, complying with all health requirements. “On March 18 we closed the borders to any Chilean or non-resident foreigner in our country. Our country took measures that were consistent with protecting the right of Chileans and residents who could return to our country. As progress has been made, the President has provided flexibility for the borders solely and exclusively through the Arturo Merino Benítez airport, subject to restrictive and sanitary measures, ”explained Undersecretary Galli. Undersecretary Paula Daza explained that all foreigners in order to board a plane and arrive in Chile must meet three requirements: a PCR taken 72 hours before boarding the plane, a mandatory health insurance that covers the benefits associated with COVID-19 and their Health Passport that they must complete at www.c19.cl However, during the first two weeks of opening of this border, between November 23 and December 7, foreigners who come from countries with community transmission, according to the WHO classification, will have to keep a 14-day quarantine in the country. This list is published weekly on its website by the World Health Organization. During their stay, in addition, foreigners must, compulsorily, complete their health status and place where they are for 14 days on a platform that will be announced next week. “This has to do with the pillar of the traceability plan. We need to know how and where the people who enter are, ”said the undersecretary. In this sense, the health authority explained that, “not complying with the mandatory monitoring for 14 days can risk serious penalties for foreigners who do not do so. Not only do you risk fines according to the Sanitary Code, you can also be taken to a Sanitary Residence whose costs will have to be self-financed and even expulsion to your country of origin. Any foreigner who enters the country must comply with the country’s sanitary measures such as use of a mask, prohibition of circulating in quarantined communes or respect for the curfew. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"52bd400c6b27f4646bbb605a7840fe5d\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07QFP5L84,B088KK99ZR,B08J7LKDLF,B077SQV1FX\";",

Health officials note that the patient had contact with camels and didn’t contract the virus from another person. This is the first case confirmed in the Kingdom since May. According to the World Health Organization, 2562 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV have been reported since September 2012. In addition, 881 MERS-CoV associated deaths have been reported in the same period. Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings. MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and compromised immune systems. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close unprotected contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"19a06afc526bf4dbdf160543641466bd\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"1633374432,B08F2T79JH,B0879CWJYW,B08HL7V6QY\";",

This increase in cases has prompted Gov. Gary R. Herbert to declare a State of Emergency today. Pursuant to the State of Emergency, the governor and Utah Department of Health have issued concurrent executive and public health orders designed to curb the surge of cases in Utah. Both orders are effective Monday, Nov. 9 and will remain in effect until Nov. 23, 2020. The orders: Gov. Gary R. Herbert said the recommendations come after a week of analysis and consideration following his meeting with Dr. Robert R. Redfield, Director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and Dr. Deborah Birx, the Coronavirus Response Coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Both stressed that requiring masks, limiting social gatherings, and testing young populations are the most critical actions communities can take to slow the spread of coronavirus. “To make a real difference in slowing the spread of COVID-19 and turning around the dire situation in our hospitals, we all need to do more,” said Gov. Gary R. Herbert. “That’s why we are restricting casual social gatherings for the next two weeks. This means many of us may have to cancel plans with extended family and friends. This is a sacrifice for all of us. But as we slow the spread it will make all the difference for our overworked healthcare workers, who desperately need our help.” To date, Utah has reported 134,868 total COVID-19 cases, with 57, 531 reported in Salt Lake County and 34,715 in Utah County.

        "main_text": "The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) today reported 12,623 new confirmed and probable cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), including 79 additional deaths. This brings the state total to 511,183 cases, including 10,289 deaths, in 102 counties in Illinois. The preliminary seven-day statewide positivity for cases as a percent of total test from November 3 – November 9 is 12.0%. In Chicago, the Department of Public Health announced it is revamping its Emergency Travel Order to better reflect the changing nature of the pandemic and provide more specific guidance to travelers entering or returning to the city amid a surge in COVID-19 cases locally and nationally. Under the new system, states will be placed in three categories – red, orange and yellow – based on the status of the outbreak in the states and how the data compares to the situation in Chicago. Previously, states with more than 15 new COVID cases per day, per 100,000 population automatically went on the quarantine list, requiring visitors and Chicagoans returning from these states to quarantine for 14 days. The new guidance is as follows: “First and foremost, I would like people to avoid travel at this time if at all possible. But by creating a tiered system and using Chicago’s case rate as a category threshold, it allows us to be responsive to the changing dynamics of the pandemic,” said CDPH Commissioner Allison Arwady. M.D. “This measure is a response to increased rates of COVID-19 transmission in Chicago and across the nation, and it sets up measures to mitigate transmission in our city.” The new guidance will go into effect on Friday, November 13, 2020, at 12:01 a.m., and it will be updated every two weeks, although this initial version will be updated after one week to get on a two-week cycle that will avoid conflict with the Thanksgiving weekend. Regardless of category, people are urged to avoid non-essential travel and to follow standard COVID-19 mitigation practices such as wearing a mask, washing hands frequently, and social distancing. Based on current data, this is where states fall: Chicago has experienced several weeks of rising new daily cases, and the test positivity rate has increased steeply and is now 13%. The city is now seeing more than 1,600 new daily cases based on a 7-day rolling average, which is a higher rate than at any time during the pandemic.",

        "main_text": "In a follow-up on the diphtheria situation affecting the Lima area of Peru, The Ministry of Health (Minsa) assured this week that Peru is not in a national emergency situation due to the cases of diphtheria registered in two districts of the capital, and urged the population to remain calm because all measures are being taken containment requirements according to protocols. Luis Suárez Ognio, Deputy Minister of Public Health of the Minsa, explained that there is an outbreak focused on the district of La Victoria, with four members of the same family who were detected the bacteria Corynebacterium diphtheriae, – unfortunately, a five-year-old girl died – but to date no other case has been registered. He clarified that the 69-year-old woman, from San Martín de Porres, who died at the Cayetano Heredia Hospital, was a carrier of a type of diphtheria bacteria that did not produce toxins and that the clinical picture she presented – which was the cause of her death – was not compatible with this disease. In the district of La Victoria – he said – the Minsa vaccinated 7,097 people in 2,955 homes around the house where the family of the deceased girl lived and carried out 88 tests on people with respiratory problems, but all were negative. In San Martín de Porres no more suspected cases have been identified either. “There is no reason to generate alarm, there is no reason to carry out a vaccination campaign for diphtheria at this time,” said Suárez Ognio, who clarified that the epidemiological alert issued by the Minsa is so that the country’s health facilities are vigilant and report any suspicious case and not to alarm the population. All children who have their full Pentavalent vaccines (3 doses) plus two boosters are protected against diphtheria.

Laboratory testing by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) identified the outbreak strain in a sample of Tanimura & Antle romaine lettuce in a single-head package. However, CDC notes there is not enough epidemiologic and traceback information available at this time to determine if ill people got sick from eating Tanimura & Antle romaine lettuce. The investigation is ongoing to determine if additional products may be contaminated with the outbreak strain of E. coli . Out of an abundance of caution, Tanimura & Antle Inc. voluntarily recalled on Nov. 6 its packaged single head romaine lettuce under the Tanimura & Antle brand, labeled with a packed on date of 10/15/2020 or 10/16/2020, due to possible contamination with E. Coli 0157:H7. E. coli O157:H7 causes a diarrheal illness often with bloody stools. Although most healthy adults can recover completely within a week, some people can develop a form of kidney failure called Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS). HUS is most likely to occur in young children and the elderly. The condition can lead to serious kidney damage and even death.

        "main_text": "The Los Angeles County Health Department is reporting an increase in wound botulism cases linked to heroin injection in recent months. Since June 1, 2020, six suspected cases of wound botulism associated with heroin injection have been reported in Los Angeles County (one case a month June through August and three cases in October). The cases are apparently unknown to each other. The sources of the heroin remain unknown. Five of the six cases presented with wound infections or abscesses and a recent history of injecting heroin. Symptoms included diplopia, ptosis, dysphagia, slurred speech, facial paralysis, difficulty breathing, and muscle weakness. Five cases required intensive care treatment and had respiratory failure requiring intubation. All patients were treated with Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (BAT®). In 2020 to date, there has been a total of 9 reported cases of wound botulism, more than twice the annual average. Between 2015-2019, twenty confirmed cases of wound botulism occurred in Los Angeles County, all of which were associated with drug use. Of these twenty, 11 cases were associated with black tar heroin, 7 with heroin and 2 were associated with injection/inhalation of cocaine and/or methamphetamine. Botulism is a rare, potentially fatal paralytic illness caused by the neurotoxins produced by Clostridium botulinum. Wound botulism occurs when a wound is contaminated by C. botulinum spores that germinate and produce toxin inside the wound. Wound botulism in drug abusers occurs in dermal abscesses from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection (skin or muscle “popping”).",

While the DOH advised the public this week against holding and attending in-person gatherings and different kinds of celebrations which may increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission, officials in Cebu City said they will strictly enforce the “no-caroling” and “no Christmas party” policy to avoid mass gatherings. Mayor Edgardo Labella said, “I hope that our carolers would understand our point here that like other traditions, we tend to postpone caroling. We are still in the middle of the pandemic.” He noted that carolers could be arrested by authorities. “Of course, we will give them the chance to stop their caroling activities,” Labella said.",

These antibodies remain in the blood for a period after infection, and in the case of re-infection, they are able to tackle the virus again. In their paper, published in Science Friday , the scientists found that some people, notably children, have antibodies reactive to SARS-CoV-2 in their blood, despite not ever having being infected with the virus. These antibodies are likely the result of exposure to other coronaviruses, which cause a common cold and which have structural similarities with SARS-CoV-2. The researchers made this discovery while developing highly sensitive antibody tests for COVID-19. To see how well their assay tests were performing, they compared the blood of patients with COVID-19 to patients who had not had the disease. Surprisingly, they found that some people who had not been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 had antibodies in their blood which would recognise the virus. To confirm their findings, they analysed over 300 blood samples collected before the pandemic, between 2011 and 2018. Nearly all samples had antibodies that reacted with common cold coronaviruses, which was expected given how everyone has been exposed to these viruses at some point in their lives. However, a small fraction of adult donors, about 1 in 20, also had antibodies that cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2, and this was not dependent on recent infection with a common cold coronavirus. Americans Get an Estimated One Billion Colds Each Year Notably, such cross-reactive antibodies were found much more frequently in blood samples taken from children aged 6 to 16. Kevin Ng, lead author and post-graduate student in the Retroviral Immunology Laboratory at the Crick says: “Our results show that children are much more likely to have these cross-reactive antibodies than adults. More research is needed to understand why this is, but it could be down to children being more regularly exposed to other coronaviruses. “These higher levels we observed in children could also help explain why they are less likely to become severely ill with COVID-19. There is no evidence yet, however, that these antibodies prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or spread.” In the lab, the researchers tested the antibodies they found in blood from uninfected people to confirm they are able to neutralise SARS-CoV-2. They found the cross-reactive antibodies target the S2 subunit of the spike protein on the surface of the virus. George Kassiotis, senior author and group leader of the Retroviral Immunology Laboratory at the Crick says: “The spike of this coronavirus is made of two parts or subunits, performing different jobs. The S1 subunit allows the virus to latch onto cells and is relatively diverse among coronaviruses, whereas the S2 subunit lets the virus into cells and is more similar among these viruses. Our work shows that the S2 subunit is sufficiently similar between common cold coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 for some antibodies to work against both. “It was previously thought that only antibodies to the S1 could block infection, but there is now good evidence that some antibodies to S2 can be just as effective. This is exciting as understanding the basis for this activity could lead to vaccines that work against a range of coronaviruses, including the common cold strains, as well as SARS-CoV-2 and any future pandemic strains. “But it is important to stress that there are still many unknowns which require further research. For example, exactly how is immunity to one coronavirus modified by exposure to another? Or why does this activity decline with age? It is not the case that people who have recently had a cold should think they are immune to COVID-19.” A large study is now underway, in partnership with researchers at Imperial College London and University College London, to uncover the role that different antibodies and other immune defences play in protection against COVID-19 and how severely ill people become.

Johnson said Saturday, “And so now is the time to take action because there is no alternative. “From Thursday until the start of December, you must stay at home. “You may only leave home for specific reasons, including: “For education; For work, say if you cannot work from home; For exercise and recreation outdoors, with your household or on your own with one person from another household; For medical reasons, appointments and to escape injury or harm; To shop for food and essentials; And to provide care for vulnerable people, or as a volunteer. “I’m afraid non-essential shops, leisure and entertainment venues will all be closed – though click and collect services can continue and essential shops will remain open, so there is no need to stock up. “Pubs, bars, restaurants must close except for takeaway and delivery services. “Workplaces should stay open where people can’t work from home – for example in the construction or manufacturing sectors. “Single adult households can still form exclusive support bubbles with one other household, and children will still be able to move between homes if their parents are separated.” The UK joins other European countries in partial or full lockdowns as cases on the continent rise. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"5059a4fd8549d1c82dcd424498b8437a\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B08KSMGQGK,B0862269YP,B085B5XW5C,B086KJBKDW\"; Johnson went on to say: “These measures above all will be time-limited, starting next Thursday 5 November. They will end on Wednesday 2 December, when we will seek to ease restrictions, going back into the tiered system on a local and regional basis according to the latest data and trends. “Christmas is going to be different this year, very different, but it is my sincere hope and belief that by taking tough action now, we can allow families across the country to be together.”",

        "main_text": "COVID-19 cases The Department of Health (DOH) on Saturday reported an additional 1796 COVID-19 cases across the country, bringing the pandemic total to 380,729. Rizal and Davao City saw the most confirmed cases with 97 and 93, respectively. The number COVID-19 related deaths has risen to 7221. DOH reporting The DOH recently enhanced the format of the COVID-19 case bulletins to make it simple, compact, and easy to understand. The communications messages also prioritize relevant information, and call for action to guide the public on how to avoid and prevent the spread of COVID-19. According to Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Singh-Vergeire, these iterations in the reporting of case bulletins aim to maintain transparency in reporting the data. Through the information that the DOH will communicate, the public will be more informed and empowered as they conduct their daily affairs, instead of succumbing to fear, panic, and anxiety during the health crisis. Philippines: Negros Occidental reports most COVID-19 cases Tuesday, Immunization campaign rolled out “Through the enhanced reporting of our case bulletins, we hope to equip the public by updating them with data that not only has integrity, but also easy to understand,” said Usec. Singh-Vergeire. One of the revisions included in the reporting of case bulletins include enhancing the content by emphasizing the most sought for information, such as reporting in percentages to create a more convenient way of informing the public on the numbers of cases and recoveries. Another enhancement is making data visualization more digestible and user-friendly. It compresses the social media cards into a single, mobile-friendly bulletin which is then targeted to the larger portion of the public who are mostly smartphone users. Additionally, design enhancements on the case bulletins also include refinement of color palette and design elements to lessen the strain in viewing complex information. The vernacular is also used to make the data more accessible and relatable to all readers. Philippines: Official says COVID-19 responsible for mental health crisis Under the new layout, the statistics included in the previous format of the case bulletin such as the case percentages (recoveries, active cases, and deaths), positivity rate, top geographic locations with new cases are all still included in the new format but now uses the Filipino language to make it more understandable to the public and help in conveying the intended message. Manila COVID-19 facilities The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) on Saturday reported the completion of four coronavirus disease (COVID-19) facilities with over 300 beds in Metro Manila. DPWH Secretary and isolation czar Mark Villar said the medical healthcare facilities for COVID-19 patients and healthcare professionals are in the cities of Parañaque, Makati, and Marikina and the Municipality of Pateros. “As part of the DPWH’s initiative in assisting the ongoing battle against COID-19 pandemic, we are making sure to efficiently provide patients and our medical professionals such facilities with this project completed earlier than the target date,” Villar said in a statement.

The league said it is committed to comply with the latest recommendation of the IATF noting that the health and safety of the 350 participants in the PBA bubble remains its top priority. Interviews at The Robert Herriman Show Facebook page The IATF’s recommended protocols are as follows: -Completion of 10-day isolation of Blackwater player from the date of swabbing before resuming the games. – Completion of 14-day quarantine and testing before entering the bubble for all those who will test positive moving forward; and – The appointment of an independent marshall, who shall oversee and ensure compliance with health and safety protocols, as recommended by the DILG. As an additional safety measure and in coordination with the Clark Development Corporation (CDC), the PBA will be assigned a separate temporary quarantine facility within the Clark Freeport Zone. These additional protocols from health experts are put in place to ensure the integrity of the bubble.

        "headline": "Vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks were sustained at ICE detention centers - Outbreak News Today",
        "main_text": "Between Jan. 1, 2017, and March 22, 2020, the researchers identified 1,280 cases of influenza, 1,052 cases of chickenpox, and 301 cases of mumps. There were 41 flu outbreaks, 26 chickenpox outbreaks, and 12 mumps outbreaks. “These numbers are pretty shocking, and very concerning,” said Nathan C. Lo, MD, PhD, the first author, who is a resident physician and public health scientist at UCSF. “They suggest this vulnerable population is being placed at very high risk for these infections while being detained.” Given how widespread the outbreaks were, Lo said federal authorities should offer vaccination to both adult and child migrants as soon as they are brought to the detention centers, which is not currently being done. The vaccines should protect people, even if they have already been exposed. Chickenpox, in particular, can be very serious and even life-threatening. “Crowding people together and giving them poor access to health care or vaccines makes these detention centers ripe for facilitating infectious outbreaks,” Lo said. The study is published October 29, 2020 in JAMA . When the study began in January of 2017, only a handful of centers reported cases of chickenpox, flu or mumps. By the time it ended in March of 2020, 17 of the 22 ICE detention centers under review had outbreaks of one or more of the three viruses. One facility had a chickenpox outbreak that lasted for 33 months, and also had year-round transmission of the influenza virus. Many centers had outbreaks of mumps. Both chickenpox and mumps are relatively rare in the general population, and flu typically circulates in the winter, but not all year round. Nearly half of the infections–44.7 percent–occurred in the South Texas Family Residential Center. Another 16.5 percent occurred at the Port Isabel Service Processing Center, also in Texas. Given how many outbreaks they found, and how long they lasted, experts said it was very likely the viruses were being spread by transfers of migrants between detention centers, which bring infected people into close contact with others who are highly susceptible to these diseases, either because they have never been vaccinated against them, or because their immunity has waned. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"48402149eb95289a858043e1c1f598f6\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"006122796X,0231186991,0465082963,1421426609\"; “Typically, migrants are detained, held for a few days, then moved to another center,” Lo said. “That moving around of people is likely a big contribution. Otherwise, how would you get so many outbreaks in so many centers with infections that are not so common?” The study most likely underestimates the number of infections. The scientists were only able to get data from the 22 centers that have the ICE electronic health record system and are served by ICE Health Service Corps. That is a small subset of the 315 facilities around the country, some of which are privately managed, that house detained migrants. Also, the data came from ICE officials at those 22 detention centers who searched the medical charts of detained migrants to see which of them had been diagnosed with chickenpox, flu or mumps, so any cases that went undiagnosed would have been missed. “These are infectious diseases that can be prevented through vaccination,” Lo said. “These detention centers are high-risk environments for infectious diseases, so we should change policy to offer vaccines that can minimize preventable suffering.”",

The case was confirmed by ELISA and Western Blot testing by the Institute for Experimental Pathology at Keldur, Univeristy of Iceland. The case was among a farm of 720 animals and was killed and disposed. In mid-October , a farmer contacted a practicing veterinarian who informed the district veterinarian about a sheep with symptoms of scrapie. The farm is located in Tröllaskagahólfur and in an area where no scrapie has been detected since 2000. Scrapie is a chronic and incurable infectious disease of sheep. The disease causes spongy degenerative damage to the brain and spinal cord. Most sheep that show symptoms are 1½-5 years old. However, there are examples of symptoms in a 7-month-old lamb and a 14-year-old lamb. The infectious agent is neither a bacterium nor a virus, but a protein, called Prion or PrP, which has changed shape and thus become pathological and has poor resilience, can withstand prolonged boiling and most disinfectants.",

        "main_text": "Latino and low-income residents had the highest prevalence of SARS-CoV-02 antibodies with rates of 17 percent and 15 percent, respectively. UCI researchers led the actOC project in partnership with the OC Health Care Agency, which provided funding, testing sites and input on the study’s survey methods and scripts. Study results appear on the pre-print server site medRxiv: https:/ / www. medrxiv. org/ content/ 10. 1101/ 2020. 10. 07. 20208660v1 “This rigorously designed surveillance study offers important information about how many residents of Orange County have already been exposed to COVID-19,” said Bernadette Boden-Albala, director of UCI’s Program in Public Health and founding dean of the campus’s proposed School of Population Health. “Additionally, the study helps us to understand the impact of disparities.” The results will enable leaders of the sixth-largest county in the U.S. to identify key demographics at higher risk of contracting – and having adverse outcomes from – the virus. “The greater prevalence of a positive antibody response among Latinx populations is consistent with some of the testing and hospital data that has come out of Orange County and nationwide,” said Boden-Albala, a co-principal investigator on the study. “As we look toward the fall and flu season, this data also justifies enhanced planning and resources in communities likely to be hit hardest.” “COVID-19 has had different impacts on different communities across our county. There has been particular concern for communities of color and residents with lower incomes that are disproportionately affected by this virus in terms of infection rates and poorer outcomes. Health equity continues to be paramount, and this study not only confirms the observable trend but also helps inform our strategies and policy recommendations moving forward to help ensure that all of our Orange County neighbors are able to attain access to testing, information and education, as well as the resources they need to care for themselves and their families,” said Dr. Clayton Chau, County Health Officer and Director of the OC Health Care Agency. A groundbreaking process Working with marketing firm LRW Group to recruit a truly representative sample of Orange County residents, the study enrolled nearly 3,000 random people via phone and email. The participants provided demographic information, revealed whether they had experienced any coronavirus symptoms, and were asked if they’d be willing to undergo blood screening for antibodies. Those who agreed visited one of 11 drive-thru testing sites – selected based on OC Health Care Agency emergency plans – where medically trained volunteers, primarily UCI students and alumni, collected blood samples using finger pinpricks. With a UCI-developed imaging platform, the researchers looked for antibody responses to a wide array of respiratory viruses – including SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. The highly sensitive technology allowed them to identify whether participants had contracted COVID-19 specifically, while many other antibody tests cannot accurately distinguish between it and other coronaviruses. The results were then analyzed and paired with the demographic data. Researchers are following up every two weeks for four months with a subset of 200 people who tested positive so that they can see how the immune response changes over time. Potential impact UCI researchers initiated the study because they had a hunch that the prevalence of COVID-19 had been underestimated, since individuals with few to no symptoms were rarely tested. “There was this lurking suspicion that there’s a large fraction of people who have had it that did not know,” said co-principal investigator Tim Bruckner, associate professor of public health. “Either they had symptoms and did not seek care, or they did not have symptoms and had no reason to go.” Recent surveys in other metropolitan regions of the U.S. suggest that infection rates are higher and death rates lower than previously thought and that rates vary significantly from place to place. The results of the actOC project confirm that nearly seven times as many county residents have contracted COVID-19 as had been believed. It’s the first study in California to employ both a truly representative sample and tests for a wide array of viral antibodies, producing an accurate picture of the disease’s prevalence in Orange County. The team included OC Health Care Agency partners Dr. Clayton Chau, County Health Officer and Director, and Dr. Matthew Zahn, Medical Director of the OC Health Care Agency’s Communicable Disease Control Division; UCI public health researchers Boden-Albala, Bruckner, Daniel Parker, Scott Bartell, Veronica Vieira and Emily Drum; and UCI School of Medicine researchers Saahir Khan and Philip Felgner. It is not yet clear what levels of antibodies indicate near- or long-term immunity for people who have had COVID-19, but continued follow-up with those who tested positive will provide further data over time. Although 11.5 percent is still substantially below the minimum of 70 percent of residents who would need to have antibodies in order to achieve herd immunity – and given that one county cannot act as a guide for the country as a whole – many researchers hope that representative antibody testing across the U.S. could help guide reopening and public health decisions. “Our study demonstrates that while a significant number of O.C. residents were already exposed and developed antibodies to COVID-19, much of the county still remains vulnerable to the virus,” Boden-Albala said. “For researchers, there is a lot more work to be done, such as understanding the protection of COVID antibodies and identifying and addressing notable disparities associated with this virus.”",

Of the total number of confirmed cases, to date, 825,197 people completed their period of home isolation or were discharged from a health facility. To date, 34,476 COVID-19 related fatalities have been reported in Peru. Diphtheria in Lima The Deputy Minister of Public Health, Luis Suárez, reported that a diphtheria case in a 5-year-old girl from Lima had passed away after four days of hospitalization. The child died Friday night from cardiac arrest at the Dos de Mayo Hospital. This was the first case of diphtheria in Lima and Peru in 20 years, Suárez noted. The girl lived  in a “border area between Cercado de Lima and La Victoria”, near the Manzanilla area. “She is a girl whose family hails from the department of Loreto, but has been in the city of Lima for a year, she had only received her birth vaccination , she had not received any vaccination again, that is, she is an unvaccinated girl”, officials said. WHO recommends a 3-dose primary vaccination series with diphtheria containing vaccine followed by 3 booster doses. The primary series should begin as early as 6-week of age with subsequent doses given with a minimum interval of 4 weeks between doses. The 3 booster doses should preferably be given during the second year of life (12-23 months), at 4-7 years and at 9-15 years of age. Ideally, there should be at least 4 years between booster doses. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"357b8e4cbae8c51aa762e89c936a7686\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"0801859786,0465057969,006122796X,B077XJBF5K\";",

        "main_text": "The government of the United Kingdom reported Monday avian influenza of the H5N2 strain has been confirmed in at a small commercial premises near Deal in Kent. All 480 birds on site will be humanely culled to limit the spread of the disease. A 1km Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) Restricted Zone has also been put in place around the infected farm to limit the risk of the disease spreading. The advice from Public Health England (PHE) is that the risk to public health from the virus is very low and the Food Standards Agency has made clear that bird flu does not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers. Thoroughly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat. Dr Gavin Dabrera, Consultant in Acute Respiratory Infections at PHE, said: A detailed investigation is in progress to determine the most likely source of this outbreak. Wild birds migrating from mainland Europe during the winter period can spread the disease to poultry and other captive birds. There are some simple measures that all poultry keepers, whether they are running a large commercial farm, keeping a few hens in their back garden, or rearing game birds, should take to protect their birds against the threat of avian flu.

        "headline": "Remdesivir receives FDA approval for the treatment of COVID-19 - Outbreak News Today",
        "main_text": "Veklury is the first treatment for COVID-19 to receive FDA approval. This approval does not include the entire population that had been authorized to use Veklury under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) originally issued on May 1, 2020. In order to ensure continued access to the pediatric population previously covered under the EUA, the FDA revised the EUA for Veklury to authorize the drug’s use for treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in hospitalized pediatric patients weighing 3.5 kg to less than 40 kg or hospitalized pediatric patients less than 12 years of age weighing at least 3.5 kg. Clinical trials assessing the safety and efficacy of Veklury in this pediatric patient population are ongoing. “The FDA is committed to expediting the development and availability of COVID-19 treatments during this unprecedented public health emergency,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “Today’s approval is supported by data from multiple clinical trials that the agency has rigorously assessed and represents an important scientific milestone in the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the FDA’s Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program , the agency will to continue to help move new medical products to patients as soon as possible, while at the same time determining whether they are effective and if their benefits outweigh their risks.” Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, approval of a new drug product requires substantial evidence of effectiveness and a demonstration of safety for the drug’s intended use(s). In considering approval of a drug, the FDA conducts a benefit-risk assessment based on rigorous scientific standards to ensure that the product’s benefits outweigh its risks for the intended population. This is different from the standard used in the issuance of an EUA . The approval of Veklury was supported by the agency’s analysis of data from three randomized, controlled clinical trials that included patients hospitalized with mild-to-severe COVID-19. One randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (ACTT-1), conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, evaluated how long it took for subjects to recover from COVID-19 within 29 days of being treated. The trial looked at 1,062 hospitalized subjects with mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 who received Veklury (n=541) or placebo (n=521), plus standard of care. Recovery was defined as either being discharged from the hospital or being hospitalized but not requiring supplemental oxygen and no longer requiring ongoing medical care. The median time to recovery from COVID-19 was 10 days for the Veklury group compared to 15 days for the placebo group, a statistically significant difference. Overall, the odds of clinical improvement at Day 15 were also statistically significantly higher in the Veklury group when compared to the placebo group. A second randomized, open-label multi-center clinical trial of hospitalized adult subjects with moderate COVID-19 compared treatment with Veklury for five days (n=191) and treatment with Veklury for 10 days (n=193) with standard of care (n=200). Researchers evaluated the clinical status of subjects on Day 11. Overall, the odds of a subject’s COVID-19 symptoms improving were statistically significantly higher in the five-day Veklury group at Day 11 when compared to those receiving only standard of care. The odds of improvement with the 10-day treatment group when compared to those receiving only standard of care were numerically favorable, but not statistically significantly different. A third separate, randomized, open-label multi-center clinical trial of hospitalized adult subjects with severe COVID-19 compared treatment with Veklury for five days (n= 200) and treatment with Veklury for 10 days (n= 197). Researchers evaluated the clinical status of subjects on Day 14. Overall, the odds of a subject’s COVID-19 symptoms improving were similar for those in the five-day Veklury group as those in the 10-day Veklury group, and there were no statistically significant differences in recovery rates or mortality rates between the two groups. Important information about using Veklury to treat COVID-19 for its approved use is available in the prescribing information which includes dosing instructions, potential side effects and drug interactions. Possible side effects include: increased levels of liver enzymes, which may be a sign of liver injury; and allergic reactions, which may include changes in blood pressure and heart rate, low blood oxygen level, fever, shortness of breath, wheezing, swelling (e.g., lips, around eyes, under the skin), rash, nausea, sweating or shivering. Similar safety information about using Veklury to treat COVID-19 in certain hospitalized pediatric patients under the EUA is available in the fact sheets for health care providers and patients/caregivers . The FDA granted this application Fast Track and Priority Review designations. The Agency also granted this application a Material Threat Medical Countermeasure Priority Review Voucher , which provides additional incentives for certain medical products intended to treat or prevent harm from specific chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats. The FDA granted approval and reissued the revised EUA to Gilead Sciences Inc. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"912e7084de586453326912fcc4810e4b\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07N9K5LND,B08KXJDVG9,B074473Z6T,B07TYN77NZ\";",

This is up from 45 confirmed cases a little over one week ago. UN officials say more than 300 cases were reported between July 2019 and February 2020 during the last chikungunya outbreak in the country. In 2018, more than 19,000 cases of chikungunya were reported across the country. With the rainy season, there is usually a spike in vector-borne diseases in Sudan as stagnant water provides a breeding ground for mosquitoes, which are the main vectors of chikungunya, malaria and other diseases. Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. Symptoms of chikungunya are fever and severe joint pain, as well as muscle pain, joint swelling, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. Joint pain associated with chikungunya is often debilitating and can vary in duration. There is currently no vaccine or specific drug for the virus and treatment focuses on relieving the disease symptoms, according to the WHO. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"912e7084de586453326912fcc4810e4b\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07N9K5LND,B08KXJDVG9,B074473Z6T,B07TYN77NZ\";",

        "main_text": "In Fiji, during National Disaster Awareness Week, Health Minister Dr Ifereimi Waqainabete spoke at the launch of the Leptospirosis, Typhoid, and Dengue Fever and Diarrhea campaign (LTDD) in Ba. Waqainabete kicked off his talk by highlighting the success Fiji has had in dealing with COVID-19 stating that it’s been more than 180 days since the last case in the community has been reported. Currently, Fiji has seen 33 cases, including two deaths. Concerning the launch of the LTDD campaign, Waqainabete said these are always issues the Ministry of Health tackles. The new platform to address the corrective actions against LTDDs during National Disaster Awareness Week was brought about Tropical Cyclone Harold in the Spring of 2020, he said. He said the relationship between natural disasters and communicable diseases are well understood. Dr. Waqainabete says they recorded 1,259 cases of leptospirosis since January this year and 50% of cases are from the Central Division. He also noted more than 4000 cases of dengue fever and 233 typhoid cases. The Health Minister says 18 lives have been lost due to Leptospirosis, three due to Dengue Fever while two have died due to Typhoid. “These numbers are alarming and depressing, a reflection of what we face because of the challenges that we have as I said before with climate sensitivity diseases”, Waqainabete said. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"9582faf2ba108c31901e1d9dc424028c\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"0241280702,1786572141\";",

All 10 people were hospitalized. One death has been reported from Florida. In interviews with 9 ill people, all reported eating Italian-style meats, such as salami, mortadella, and prosciutto. They reported purchasing prepackaged deli meats and meats sliced at deli counters at various locations. A specific type of deli meat and common supplier have not yet been identified. CDC says people who are at higher risk for getting sick with Listeria should avoid eating deli meats, unless heated to an internal temperature of 165°F or until steaming hot just before serving. Clean: Wash your hands after handling deli meats. Clean refrigerator shelves, kitchen countertops, utensils, and other surfaces that may have come into contact with deli meats. Separate: Don’t let juice from deli meats get on other foods, utensils, and food preparation services. Chill: Keep factory-sealed, unopened packages of deli meats in the refrigerator for no longer than 2 weeks. Keep opened packages and meat sliced at a local deli in the refrigerator for no longer than 5 days. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"e9453e3ece9c4cd8245a2a81228ba36a\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B08FPNRYXN,B07SBK9LRY,B088X2YR3X,B08KSMGQGK\";",

        "main_text": "The Colombia Ministry of Health recorded an additional 8769 confirmed COVID-19 cases Saturday, putting the country total case count over the one million mark, the eighth country to do so. As of Oct 24, Colombia has seen 1,007,711 total cases, following only the US, India, Brazil, Russia, France, Argentina and Spain. More than 900,000 people have recovered and their are currently 68,000 active cases in Colombia. With the addition of 198 fatalities Saturday, 30,000 deaths due to COVID-19 have been reported. Bogota has reported 308,000 cases, leading the country, followed by Antioquia (153K) and Valle del Cauca (77K). On Thursday, the country launched the National Contact Center for Telephone Tracking as part of the implementation of the PRASS program in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Minister of Health and Social Protection, Fernando Ruiz Gómez, pointed out that the PRASS program has been operating in Colombia for a few months, through which tests, tracking, isolation and monitoring of people with COVID-19 and their contacts are carried out. “This new service that will reach all Colombians seeks, essentially, to be able to reach people who have COVID-19 and to be able to immediately make a call, establish contacts and the risks they may have, this also to proceed to isolate them and avoid that in the context of opening there are possibilities of contagion”. Costa Rica: 27 deaths due to methanol intoxication, 7,450 liters of tainted liquor seized He described this as an essential strategy to reduce contagion, and detailed that the center has a capacity for 140 thousand calls a day with operation from 8 in the morning to 8 at night every day. “People will see the number 19000 on the phone screen and they will ask questions, make recommendations to take care of ourselves and address the risks of spread,” he said. This “is important news for the country” and he invited Colombians to collaborate with the information in order to better monitor the virus and keep the numbers stable. Lastly, with Halloween right around the corner, health officials explained the general recommendations for the next Halloween celebration in the country during his intervention in the Prevention and Action program. “Today we issued with the Ministry of the Interior, the Presidential Council for Children and Adolescents and the Colombian Institute for Family Welfare, a joint circular of orientation to mayors and governors about the children’s party or Halloween,” Ruiz Gómez said. Argentina COVID-19: Case count tops 1 million, Half in Buenos Aires He pointed out the risks that Halloween brings, among which are: crowds, difficulty in physical distancing, exchange of objects that may have the virus on their surface (bags, sweets, costumes, masks, make-up) and intergenerational contact, which creates a great risk for older adults. In the same way, he stressed the general recommendations for citizens: amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"a601ae570821542df97779341361e7e3\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B00JSJOSW0,B072VWXZBC,B0759NSGMV,B01I0Q2QB6\"; “The recreation that occurs on Halloween is essential for the mental health of children and therefore it is very important. But a different Halloween, like the one we have in this pandemic environment, is not necessarily a less happy Halloween. We have to adapt and take advantage of the measures we recommend to work in our families, “said Ruiz Gómez.

Of the country’s 77 provinces, five remain chikungunya free- Singburi, Nakhon Nayok, Mae Hong Son , Udon Thani and Yasothon. The World Health Organization says chikungunya is an arboviral disease transmitted to humans by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes. The disease is characterized by an abrupt onset of fever frequently accompanied by joint pain and inflammation which is often very debilitating and may last for several months, or even years. Fatalities associated with infection can occur but are typically rare and most reported in older adults with underlying medical conditions or perinatally-infected infants. Some patients might have a relapse of rheumatologic symptoms (e.g. polyarthralgia, polyarthritis, and tenosynovitis) in the months following acute illness. There is no specific antiviral treatment or commercially available vaccine for chikungunya. Aedes aegypti mosquito",

        "main_text": "French health authorities reported 13 laboratory-confirmed cases of Mayaro fever in French Guiana earlier this month. According to the World Health Organization , in September 2020, the Institut Pasteur de la Guyane (IPG) identified two cases of Mayaro virus infection (MAYV) confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and one probable case found positive for Mayaro antibodies. Additional confirmed cases of Mayaro fever were reported after a retrospective search on samples collected between 15 July and 15 September. In total (including the first detections and retrospective search) IPG identified 11 cases of Mayaro fever by RT-PCR out of 79 samples tested. These cases were reported on 21 September 2020. Two additional confirmed cases of Mayaro fever were reported in early October by the Institute Pasteur de la Guyane in Cayenne, leading to a total of 13 confirmed cases among 97 tested samples between 15 July and early October. The onset of symptoms for the 13 confirmed cases ranged from 18 July to 29 September 2020. Of the 13 confirmed cases, 11 lived in the urban coastal area including nine from Cayenne area (Cayenne: 1, Rémire: 4, Matoury: 4), one from Kourou, and one from Montsinery-Tonnegrande. Only two cases lived in a rural/sylvatic area, both in Roura (including one in the village of Cacao, located further in the interior). French Guiana: Oropouche virus outbreak reported, 1st cases in the country French Guiana has seen circulation of Mayaro for more than 20 years reporting 1 to 3 confirmed cases annually in recent years. Detection of 13 confirmed cases within less than 3 months is thus unusual. MAYV is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) that can cause Mayaro fever. Disease may can include 4 days of viremia, a rash that may appear after a 3-5 day fever, headache, photophobia, inguinal lymphadenopathy, myalgia, vomiting, diarrhea and arthralgia, which can affect ankles, wrists and toes and less often, other joints. Joint pain may continue for weeks and maybe very painful. Disease is clinically similar to that due to primary dengue virus or chikungunya virus infection. MAYV was first described in 1954 after its discovery in in Mayaro County, Trinidad. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"9dc44bce2caa5ccadd82bbeb3978b2d7\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B08BLBYKQ6,1524743410,0190056789,0140250913\";",

The number of cases last week is still of concern as the weekly number is more than four times the number of cases seen in the corresponding period averaged over the last three years. The cumulative number of dengue cases for this year is nearly 32,000, a record for Singapore. The number of dengue fatalities stands at 28, the same number of fatalities the city-state has reported from COVID-19. The situation is not over in Singapore as the number of active dengue clusters reported continues to remain high. As of 12 October 2020, there are 176 active dengue clusters reported, where intensive dengue transmission is ongoing. In addition, the mosquito population is still high.

        "main_text": "Specialty vaccine company, Valneva, today announced positive initial results for its second Phase 2 study (VLA15-202) of Lyme disease vaccine candidate VLA15. Compared to study VLA15-201, study VLA15-202 investigated a vaccination schedule of Month 0-2-6 based on matching doses. VLA15 was generally safe across all doses and age groups tested. The tolerability profile including fever rates was comparable to other lipidated recombinant vaccines or lipid containing formulations. As in VLA15-201, no related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were observed in any treatment group. Reactogenicity decreased following the first vaccination. Compared to study VLA15-201, immunogenicity was further enhanced using a Month 0-2-6 schedule. SCRs (Seroconversion Rates), after completion of the primary vaccination series, showed similar responses and ranged from 93.8% [ST1] to 98.8% [ST2, ST4]. Antibody responses were comparable in the two dose groups tested. The immunological response in older adults, one of the main target groups for a Lyme vaccine, is particularly encouraging, as already observed in VLA15-201. Furthermore, results did not indicate that prior exposure to Borrelia spirochetes (sero-positivity) has an impact on immunogenicity or safety, also as observed in VLA15-201. A Serum Bactericidal Assay (SBA), assessing the functional immune response against Lyme disease after vaccination with VLA15, was conducted for the first time and demonstrated functionality of antibodies against all OspA serotypes. Assays, such as SBAs, are commonly used to enable a potential prediction of vaccine efficacy via the measurement of vaccine-induced functional immune responses. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"6f70c4703eda6c68cd45f91db1fb7056\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"0062896288,1610918444,B00KI1I7BU,B075DKL3Z6\"; Juan Carlos Jaramillo, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Valneva, commented, “We are extremely pleased with these results which showed an excellent immunological profile, further supported by additional positive data through the Serum Bactericidal Assay (SBA). With these encouraging data we are now well positioned to continue development. Lyme disease continues to be a high unmet medical need and our objective remains to work closely with Pfizer to offer a preventative solution as soon as possible.” VLA15-202 Day 208 safety and immunogenicity data support advancing the program with the Month 0-2-6 schedule. Valneva and Pfizer will finalize dosage analysis and prepare for the next development steps in the coming months.

        "main_text": "The Hawaii Department of Health is reporting the rate of syphilis cases in women and newborns in the state has been increasing annually over the past four years. “While we know everyone’s current attention is focused on preventing the spread of COVID-19, we must also pay close attention to syphilis because of the potential health effects, especially for developing babies,” said Dr. Glenn Wasserman, chief of the Department of Health’s Communicable Disease and Public Health Nursing Division. “Syphilis is preventable and easily treatable when diagnosed early.” In Hawai‘i, the number of babies born with syphilis — known as congenital syphilis — ranged from zero to two cases per year from 2000 to 2016, three to four cases per year from 2017 to 2019, and 11 probable cases so far in 2020. The more recent rapid rise of cases in women and now of congenital syphilis, although still low, reflects an increasing trend and requires immediate attention. “All sexually active women with risk factors for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) should be regularly tested for syphilis and other STIs,” Wasserman said. “We are now recommending that pregnant women with risk factors for STIs be tested as early as possible during the first trimester, at 28 to 32 weeks of gestation and again at the time of delivery. It is also important that sexual partners are also adequately treated to prevent women from becoming re-infected.” Early cases of syphilis in adults are particularly infectious, while later stages of this disease can lead to significant damage to numerous organs, including the heart and brain. Pregnant mothers with syphilis can transmit the disease to their unborn fetus at any stage, causing miscarriage, stillbirth, prematurity, low birth weight or death before or shortly after birth. Babies born with syphilis can have deformed bones, severe anemia, central nervous system and other problems. Japan records more than 4,000 syphilis cases in 1st 9 months of 2020 Hawai‘i’s trends in syphilis rates mirror national trends. Men account for most cases of syphilis, with most of those cases occurring among men who have sex with men. Hawai‘i has emphasized prevention, early identification and treatment as the incidence of these cases increased. Diagnosing syphilis can be tricky as signs of infection may not be apparent especially during latent phases of infection. Screening for syphilis requires two different types of tests. Reinfection of pregnant mothers may be difficult to identify. The health department is alerting health care providers to be vigilant for cases of syphilis in women and during pregnancy, emphasizing recommendations for diagnosing and treating cases, re-emphasizing treatment of partners to prevent re-infection, and providing follow up for patients and infants. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"6f70c4703eda6c68cd45f91db1fb7056\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"0029166764,1634908287\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";",

        "main_text": "The northwestern African country of Mauritania is reporting an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) where some three dozen confirmed cases have been reported. As of Oct. 5, 2020, a total of 88 samples of suspected cases have been sent to the National Institute for Public Health Research (INRSP): 36 were positive (by PCR and Elisa), 46 were negative. Six samples are still pending for results. Confirmed cases have been reported in 9 regions (Adrar, Assaba, Brakna, Hodh Elchargui, Hodh El Gharby, Tagant, Trarza, Gorgol et Noukchott Sud). 13 total deaths have been reported from the confirmed cases, for a case-fatality of 36 percent. The continuous surveillance of RVF at the animal level has confirmed the outbreaks in the Assaba, Tagant, Brakna, Trarza and Hodh Elgharbi regions. The results of 165 samples taken in the period from September 16 to 23, 2020, show that 33 camelids, 4 small ruminants and 6 cattle were positive. According to WHO , Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is caused by a virus transmitted by mosquitoes and blood feeding flies that usually affects animals (commonly cattle and sheep) but can also involve humans. In humans the disease ranges from a mild flu-like illness to severe hemorrhagic fever that can be lethal. When livestock are infected the disease can cause significant economic losses due to high mortality rate in young animals and waves of abortions in pregnant females. Subscribe to Outbreak News TV on YouTube The majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can be transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting veterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses. Certain occupational groups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians are therefore at higher risk of infection. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"c5aa5c27187e92a0ab4da22d8c33d551\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B08L163TDD,1589881222,1555819257,0393346617\";",

        "main_text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) reports from July 1 to September 25, 2020, a total of 71 cases of febrile and non-febrile jaundice and 10 deaths have been officially recorded by the national authorities. 58 cases were reported in the health district of Barsalogho, in the North Center region of Burkina Faso. The 10 deaths are reported in pregnant women and postpartum women. The clinical course of hepatitis E is similar to that of hepatitis A with no chronic form of the disease. Jaundice, fever, loss of appetite and lethargy are common symptoms. People are infected primarily through the fecal-oral route, usually through contaminated water or food. There have been several cases of hepatitis E infection in France due to eating raw figatellu, which is made with pig liver. Much like hepatitis A, the fatality rate is low with the exception of pregnant women where it can reach 20% among those infected in the third trimester. Liver failure is a frequent outcome with pregnant women. Hepatitis E is found endemically in countries that have inadequate environmental sanitation. It is most frequently seen in Asia, Africa, Central America and the Middle East. According to WHO, every year, there are an estimated 20 million hepatitis E infections worldwide, leading to an estimated 3.3 million symptomatic cases of hepatitis E, and 56,600 hepatitis E-related deaths.

        "main_text": "Q fever is a bacterial infection carried by animals – such as cows, sheep and goats – and can lead to chronic lethargy that may last for several months Ms Turcato said a single dose vaccine is recommended for people who work in high-risk occupations, as well as for people aged 15 years and over who could be exposed to Q fever. There have been 51 confirmed cases of Q Fever reported in WNSWLHD so far in 2020. The risk of ongoing health issues, such as chronic fatigue, can really hit individuals and families hard and affect their ability to work, Ms Turcato said. With all the pressure on farmers and livestock handlers with the recent drought and the COVID-19 pandemic, the last thing we want is for them to be needlessly drained of energy for months on end after being struck down by Q fever Ms Turcato said. People become infected when they breathe in dust particles contaminated by infected animal secretions, which can lead to high fevers and chills, sweating, severe headaches, muscle and joint pains and extreme fatigue. Ms Turcato urged anyone who might be at risk to consult a GP who can screen for Q fever and vaccinate them, if needed. “We want people to proactively talk to their doctor about Q fever.” Children who help with farm animals may also be at risk, but the vaccine is not recommended for children younger than 15 years. Ms Turcato said many of the behaviours adopted during COVID-19 can help keep people safe. ​“Vigilant hand washing, protective masks, protective clothing and removing clothes worn for chores outside before entering the family home are behaviours to be reinforced because they can protect those who cannot be vaccinated.” The NSW Government is investing around $1 million between 2018 and 2022 to help protect farmers and other people in rural areas who work with animals from Q fever. NSW Health is currently delivering an education campaign targeting people in occupations and locations at higher risk of Q fever. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"c5aa5c27187e92a0ab4da22d8c33d551\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B08L163TDD,1589881222,1555819257,0393346617\";",

This is the fifth straight year the country has exceeded 4,000 cases of the sexually transmitted infection. This includes more than 1,100 cases in Tokyo, 661 in Osaka and 229 each in Aichi and Fukuoka prefectures. Syphilis was a major issue in Japan until shortly after the end of World War II, but the total reported cases declined to several hundred annually until 2011, when a rebound began. Syphilis is a sexually-transmitted disease (STD) that can cause long-term complications if not treated correctly. Symptoms of syphilis in adults include a painless sore that will go away without treatment followed by a non-itchy body rash. If left untreated syphilis can lead to damage through the body including neurological and cardiovascular complications. Syphilis also increases the risk of HIV infection and, for women, can cause problems during pregnancy and for the newborn. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"3ca84c74d20830de5b1fc3f4e60ea255\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07KY5KPMD,B00ANRUELK,B07GFRG49Y,B07DQS9VX9\";",

        "main_text": "“Today’s action demonstrates the FDA’s ongoing commitment to responding to public health threats—both domestically and abroad—on the basis of science and data,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “This approval was made possible because of our steadfast dedication to facilitate the development of safe and effective treatments for infectious diseases as part of our vital public health mission.” Zaire ebolavirus , commonly known as Ebola virus, is one of four Ebolavirus species that can cause a potentially fatal human disease. Ebola virus is transmitted through direct contact with blood, body fluids and tissues of infected people or wild animals, as well as with surfaces and materials, such as bedding and clothing, contaminated with these fluids. Individuals who provide care for people with Ebola virus, including health care workers who do not use correct infection control precautions, are at the highest risk for infection. Inmazeb targets the glycoprotein that is on the surface of Ebola virus. Glycoprotein attaches to the cell receptor and fuses the viral and host cell membranes allowing the virus to enter the cell. The three antibodies that make up Inmazeb can bind to this glycoprotein simultaneously and block attachment and entry of the virus. Ebola outbreak rises to 125 cases, Allegations of sexual exploitation to be investigated Inmazeb was evaluated in 382 adult and pediatric patients with confirmed Zaire ebolavirus infection in one clinical trial (the PALM trial) and as part of an expanded access program conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) during an Ebola virus outbreak in 2018-2019. The PALM trial was led by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the DRC’s Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale with contributions from several other international organizations and agencies. “Today’s approval highlights the importance of international collaboration in the fight against Ebola virus,” said John Farley, M.D., MPH, director of the Office of Infectious Diseases in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “The urgent need for advanced therapies to combat this infectious disease is clear, and today’s action is a significant step forward in that effort.” In the PALM trial, the safety and efficacy of Inmazeb was evaluated in a multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial, in which 154 patients received Inmazeb (50 mg of each monoclonal antibody) intravenously as a single infusion, and 168 patients received an investigational control. The primary efficacy endpoint was 28-day mortality. The primary analysis population was all patients who were randomized and concurrently eligible to receive either Inmazeb or the investigational control during the same time period of the trial. Of the 154 patients who received Inmazeb, 33.8% died after 28 days, compared to 51% of the 153 patients who received a control. In the expanded access program, an additional 228 patients received Inmazeb. The most common symptoms experienced while receiving Inmazeb included: fever, chills, tachycardia (fast heart rate), tachypnea (fast breathing), and vomiting; however, these are also common symptoms of Ebola virus infection. Patients who receive Inmazeb should avoid the concurrent administration of a live vaccine due to the treatment’s potential to inhibit replication of a live vaccine virus indicated for prevention of Ebola virus infection and possibly reduce the vaccine’s efficacy. Hypersensitivity, including infusion-related events, can occur in patients taking Inmazeb, and treatment should be discontinued in the event of a hypersensitivity reaction. Inmazeb received an Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of Ebola virus infection. The Orphan Drug designation provides incentives to assist and encourage drug development for rare diseases. Additionally, the agency granted Inmazeb a Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of Zaire ebolavirus infection. The FDA is granting the approval to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. The FDA approved Ervebo, the first vaccine for the prevention of Ebola virus disease, in December 2019, with support from a study conducted in Guinea during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak.",

In humans, Oropouche virus it is transmitted primarily through the bite of the Culicoides paraensis midge. No direct transmission of the virus from human to human has been documented. Oropouche fever causes symptoms similar to those of dengue with an incubation period of 4-8 days (range: 3-12 days). Symptoms include the sudden onset of high fever, headache, myalgia, joint pain, and vomiting. In some patients it can cause clinical symptoms of aseptic meningitis.

Chanthaburi province has seen the highest incidence of chikungunya. Subscribe to Outbreak News TV Dengue is a viral infection transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. There are four closely related but antigenically different serotypes of the virus that can cause dengue (DEN1, DEN 2, DEN 3, DEN 4). Dengue Fever (DF) – marked by an onset of sudden high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, and pain in muscles and joints. Some may also have a rash and varying degree of bleeding from various parts of the body (including nose, mouth and gums or skin bruising).Dengue has a wide spectrum of infection outcome (asymptomatic to symptomatic). Symptomatic illness can vary from dengue fever (DF) to the more serious dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Dengue in 2019, the vaccines and the quest for a World Dengue Day Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) – is a more severe form, seen only in a small proportion of those infected. DHF is a stereotypic illness characterized by 3 phases; febrile phase with high continuous fever usually lasting for less than 7 days; critical phase (plasma leaking) lasting 1-2 days usually apparent when fever comes down, leading to shock if not detected and treated early; convalescence phase lasting 2-5 days with improvement of appetite, bradycardia (slow heart rate), convalescent rash (white patches in red background), often accompanied by generalized itching (more intense in palms and soles), and diuresis (increase urine output). Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS) — Shock syndrome is a dangerous complication of dengue infection and is associated with high mortality. Severe dengue occurs as a result of secondary infection with a different virus serotype. Increased vascular permeability, together with myocardial dysfunction and dehydration, contribute to the development of shock, with resultant multiorgan failure. WHO notes the incidence of dengue has grown dramatically around the world in recent decades. A vast majority of cases are asymptomatic and hence the actual numbers of dengue cases are underreported and many cases are misclassified. One estimate indicates 390 million dengue infections per year (95% credible interval 284–528 million), of which 96 million (67–136 million) manifest clinically (with any severity of disease). Another study, of the prevalence of dengue, estimates that 3.9 billion people, in 128 countries, are at risk of infection with dengue viruses. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"d98e8dd5fe0d67068788a916085a261b\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"1786570580,1628874023,158008284X,B002A7AI58\"; Aedes aegypti mosquito",

        "main_text": "Since the beginning of the year, 61 total Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cases have been reported through October 6, mostly in Saudi Arabia. No new cases have been reported in several months. Of the 61 cases, 57 were reported from Saudi Arabia (nearly half of the cases are from Riyadh), while the remaining cases were seen in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. Twenty fatalities have been reported in the Saudi Kingdom. The vast majority of cases were primary (50), while the remaining are healthcare related. About a third of the primary cases reported contact with camels. Since 2012, more than 2500 MERS cases have been reported globally, including 935 deaths. Typical MERS symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is common, but not always present. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, have also been reported. Some laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection are reported as asymptomatic, meaning that they do not have any clinical symptoms, yet they are positive for MERS-CoV infection following a laboratory test. Most of these asymptomatic cases have been detected following aggressive contact tracing of a laboratory-confirmed case. Approximately 35% of reported patients with MERS-CoV infection have died. Although most of human cases of MERS-CoV infections have been attributed to human-to-human infections in health care settings, current scientific evidence suggests that dromedary camels are a major reservoir host for MERS-CoV and an animal source of MERS infection in humans. However, the exact role of dromedaries in transmission of the virus and the exact route(s) of transmission are unknown. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"732911acaec343eaf8a5a2cf0ce1dccc\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"1589881222,0316343757\";",

Quezon City has reported more than 2,000 new cases in the past 14 days, the most of any province. Measles The Presidential Palace, or Malacañang today urged urged parents to get their children vaccinated for measles following predictions of a possible measles outbreak in 2021. Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said failing to get their children vaccinated could put their health at great risk. Roque allayed fears against the government’s immunization campaign, saying a measles vaccine is one of the “oldest” vaccines to be used globally. He acknowledged concerns over vaccines after issues hounding the Dengvaxia anti-dengue vaccine but noted that the case for measles vaccines is different. Last Wednesday, the Department of Health (DOH) said it will conduct a nationwide immunization campaign to prevent a predicted measles outbreak next year. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"d98e8dd5fe0d67068788a916085a261b\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"039951144X,1734124105,B07F68GD8H,1641526289\";",

These financial problems will lead to psychological stress and mental health problems,” Brillantes said. He emphasized the need for affected individuals to be open with their problems and seek guidance from experts to help them cope with and face the problem. Lastly, Brillantes said that the COVID-19 crisis may increase suicide rates during and after the pandemic, underscoring the importance of traditional and social media campaigns to promote mental health and reduce distress.

CDC continues to believe, based on current science, that people are more likely to become infected the longer and closer they are to a person with COVID-19. The recent website update acknowledges the existence of some published reports showing limited, uncommon circumstances where people with COVID-19 infected others who were more than 6 feet away or shortly after the COVID-19-positive person left an area. This kind of spread is referred to as airborne transmission and is an important way that infections like tuberculosis, measles, and chicken pox are spread. In these instances, transmission occurred in poorly ventilated and enclosed spaces that often involved activities that caused heavier breathing, like singing or exercise.  Such environments and activities may contribute to the buildup of virus-carrying particles. CDC states people can protect themselves from the virus that causes COVID-19 by staying at least 6 feet away from others, wearing a mask that covers their nose and mouth, washing their hands frequently, cleaning touched surfaces often and staying home when sick. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"aebd541ba8af35f287d88ae728ab5937\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B085G14RGY,B00RKNND2W,B08KHXC8NF,B088KT6C1W\";",

Cases have been confirmed in health districts of Abéché (Ouaddai Province), Biltine (Wadi Fira Province), and d’Abdi, Gozbeida (Sila Province). More than three quarters of patients develop severe fevers, headaches, excruciating and disabling joint pain; a third of these patients developed pruritic maculopapular rashes. The World Health Organization says chikungunya is an arboviral disease transmitted to humans by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes. The disease is characterized by an abrupt onset of fever frequently accompanied by joint pain and inflammation which is often very debilitating and may last for several months, or even years. Fatalities associated with infection can occur but are typically rare and most reported in older adults with underlying medical conditions or perinatally-infected infants. Some patients might have a relapse of rheumatologic symptoms (e.g. polyarthralgia, polyarthritis, and tenosynovitis) in the months following acute illness. There is no specific antiviral treatment or commercially available vaccine for chikungunya. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"aebd541ba8af35f287d88ae728ab5937\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B08CVGTPMP,B07F1GBWJK\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";",

        "main_text": "The India Ministry of Health is now reporting more than 7 million total confirmed COVID-19 cases, the second country to reach this level. Of the total of 7,053,806 cases, 6,077,976, or 86 percent have recovered leaving 867,496 active cases. The Indian states reporting the most include Maharashtra (1.5 million),  Andhra Pradesh (750,000), Karnataka (700,000) and  Tamil Nadu (650,000). The total deaths in India are 108,334, or 1.5 percent of the total cases. So the question is, why is India’s death rate so low? A recent Times of India report looks at this question, and there are a number of theories. One is that India has a younger population than countries with higher death rates like the United States and countries in Europe. India ranks #1 globally in 11 neglected tropical diseases The viral disease is well documented as having a harsher effect on the older population, especially with underlying health conditions like diabetes and heart disease, while India has a younger population with a median age of 28 years. Another possible explanation is COVID-19 treatments in the earliest stages of the pandemic when European countries were battling the disease and when India’s outbreak started to take hold at least a month later, some treatments had become more established. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"4cbadf36b1ba48644ded5b8a04d3cd2c\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07CP6LRVX,0393346617,0140250913,0393310086\"; It has also been suggested that viral diseases like dengue fever may provide some immunity to COVID-19. In a study that looked at the outbreak in Brazil, the researchers said places with lower coronavirus infection rates and slower case growth were locations that had suffered intense dengue outbreaks this year or last. India is also a dengue fever endemic country. Lastly, it could be due to just undercounting. “Our poor routine death surveillance system… misses many deaths in the first place, according to a community medicine expert in India. Or maybe it’s some combination of two or more factors.

The number of confirmed cases, the positive rates of samples, especially in people with symptoms, are increasing. On the other hand, the detection rate is decreasing. It is likely that the use of diagnostics has evolved in recent weeks due to strong pressures on the diagnostic capacity of laboratories in several regions and recent recommendations on the prioritization of tests. At the hospital level, the number of new hospitalizations, in particular admissions to intensive care units and deaths occurring in hospital, is increasing. Nationally, new hospitalizations, ICU admissions for COVID-19 and death numbers currently remain at moderate levels compared to the situation observed in March-April 2020, but the increased circulation of the virus, in particularly among the elderly, raises fears of continued hospitalizations and deaths in the weeks to come. The greatest vigilance must be maintained with people at risk, especially the elderly, given the fragility of this population in which the greatest number of deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 occurs. As of October 9, 2020, 70 departments are in a situation of high vulnerability. In order to slow the progression of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it is important to maintain the “Test-Alert-Protect” strategy: each person presenting symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, even mild, must carry out as soon as possible a diagnostic test. While awaiting results, people should isolate themselves and reduce their contact to the strict minimum. However, diagnostic delays could lead to less effective contact tracing measures due to the delay in identifying cases and their contacts and in implementing isolation and quarantine measures. In the absence of curative treatment and vaccine, it seems essential to strengthen the actions of p r evention including measures of hygiene, physical distance, reduction of contact (without hugging, without shaking hands, avoiding groupings) as well as the appropriate wearing of the mask. To date, France has reported 732,434 confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 32,601 total deaths. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"1f7cf49f39db0bdfd7019971ab150c59\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07KQBJJXN,B084MBWPHB\";",

        "main_text": "The antibody solution being tested in the ITAC trial is anti-coronavirus hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin, or hIVIG. The antibodies in anti-coronavirus hIVIG come from the liquid portion of blood, or plasma, donated by healthy people who have recovered from COVID-19. These antibodies are highly purified and concentrated so that the anti-coronavirus hIVIG consistently contains several times more SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies than typically found in the plasma of people who have recovered from COVID-19. The ITAC investigators hypothesize that giving people anti-coronavirus hIVIG at the onset of COVID-19 symptoms, before the body makes a protective immune response on its own, could augment the natural antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, thereby reducing the risk of more serious illness and death. “Finding safe and effective treatments for COVID-19 is absolutely critical,” said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “The ITAC trial will examine whether adding anti-coronavirus hIVIG to a remdesivir regimen can give the immune system a needed boost to suppress SARS-CoV-2 early in the course of illness, nipping the infection in the bud.” Leading the ITAC trial is Protocol Chair Mark Polizzotto, M.D., Ph.D., head of the Therapeutic and Vaccine Research Program at The Kirby Institute in the University of New South Wales, Sydney. The University of Minnesota is the coordinating center for the trial, which is being conducted by the NIAID-funded International Network for Strategic Initiatives in Global HIV Trials (INSIGHT). While INSIGHT was established to conduct clinical studies on HIV, it also has been involved in clinical trials related to influenza-like illness and the role of anti-influenza hIVIG since 2009. The ITAC trial also is known as INSIGHT 013. Four companies are collaborating to provide anti-coronavirus hIVIG for the trial: Emergent BioSolutions of Gaithersburg, Maryland; Grifols S.A. of Barcelona; CSL Behring of King of Prussia, Pennsylvania; and Takeda Pharmaceuticals of Tokyo. The hIVIG from Emergent BioSolutions and Grifols S.A. was developed with support from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. CSL Behring and Takeda Pharmaceuticals are providing anti-coronavirus hIVIG on behalf of a partnership of plasma companies called the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance. Remdesivir is currently recommended for treating certain hospitalized patients with COVID-19, based on an analysis of available data from the NIAID-sponsored Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT). ACTT found that hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and lower respiratory tract involvement who received remdesivir had a statistically significant shorter time to recovery compared to patients who received placebo. Remdesivir is an investigational broad-spectrum antiviral discovered and developed by Gilead Sciences, Inc. of Foster City, California. The ITAC study team will enroll 500 hospitalized adults ages 18 or older who provide informed consent, have had COVID-19 symptoms for 12 days or fewer, and do not have life-threatening organ dysfunction or organ failure. Enrollment will occur at up to 58 sites in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America. Study participants will be assigned at random to receive infusions of either anti-coronavirus hIVIG and remdesivir or a placebo and remdesivir. Neither the participants nor the study team will know who is receiving which treatment regimen. Subscribe to Outbreak News TV hIVIG will be given as a single infusion of 400 milligrams (mg) per kilogram of current body weight. Remdesivir infusions will be administered as a 200-mg loading dose followed by a 100-mg once-daily intravenous maintenance dose during hospitalization for up to 10 days in total. The main goal of the ITAC trial is to compare the health status of participants in the combination treatment group with participants in the remdesivir-only group on day 7. Health status will be based on an ordinal outcome with seven mutually exclusive categories ranging from no limiting symptoms due to COVID-19, to death. These categories capture the full range of severity experienced by hospitalized patients with COVID-19, according to the study investigators. ITAC study participants will be followed for 28 days. If the trial goes to completion, the primary analysis will be completed after all participants finish 28 days of follow-up. An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will review interim safety and efficacy data to ensure patient well-being and safety as well as study integrity. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"1f7cf49f39db0bdfd7019971ab150c59\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Paid links\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07KQBJJXN,B084MBWPHB\";",

        "headline": "Pork tapeworm: 1st locally acquired neurocysticercosis case reported in Melbourne, Australia - Outbreak News Today",
        "main_text": "A parasitic disease normally just seen in Africa, Asia, and Latin America has been reported in a 25-year-old Melbourne, Australia woman with no history of travel, according to a case report in The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is a disease caused by infection of the central nervous system with the larval stage of the tapeworm Taenia solium. The woman presented with worsening visual symptoms in association with headache, diagnosed previously as a migraine with visual aura. She had suffered from migraines since 18; however, a recent episode did not disappear. A scan on the brain revealed lesion in the right bottom of her brain which upon removal revealed tapeworm larvae. How she contracted the parasite is still a mystery and it is speculated she contracted it from a carrier. This is the first recorded autochthonous case of NCC  in Australia. What is the pork tapeworm? Taenia solium is a tapeworm that people get from eating raw or undercooked “measly pork”. The pork meat has cysticerci (the larval stage) which in the human intestine mature to an adult tapeworm. Here the tapeworm attaches to the intestine and produces thousands of eggs. Does the pork tapeworm cause disease while in the intestine? Most people are asymptomatic and only become aware of the tapeworm by noticing segments of the worm in their feces. Symptoms of infection, if any, are general: nausea, intestinal upset, vague abdominal symptoms such as hunger pains, diarrhea and/or constipation, or chronic indigestion. What is cysticercosis? Human cysticercosis occurs either by the direct transfer of Taenia solium eggs from the feces of people harboring an adult worm to their own mouth (autoinfection) or to the mouth of another individual, or indirectly by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the eggs. When the person ingests the eggs, the embryo escape from the shell and penetrates the intestinal wall, gets into the blood vessels, where they spread to muscle, or more seriously, the eyes, heart or brain. How serious is cysticercosis? The severity of cystercercosis depends on which organs are infected and the number of cysticerci. An infection consisting of a few small cysticerci in the liver or muscles would likely result in no obvious disease and go unnoticed. Those that form in voluntary muscle tend to be asymptomatic, but may cause some pain. On the other hand, a few cysticerci, if located in a particularly “sensitive” area of the body, might result in irreparable damage. For instance, a cysticercus in the eye might lead to blindness, or a cysticercus in the brain (neurocysticercosis) could lead to traumatic neurological damage, epileptic seizures or brain swelling that can kill. Neurocysticercosis is rarely acquired in economically affluent regions, including North America, Central Europe, Japan, and Australia, and in countries where pork consumption is discouraged by religious or social practices. In these countries, NCC is usually diagnosed in immigrants or returning travelers who have spent time in endemic regions. This case report serves to put physicians on high alert for the possibility of infections in places where they least expect them. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"d272a1b8e997939cebdee8c3bbce70c2\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07W3QVTTM,B071ZQMBBT,B071K8N8MY,B07DNSQRL7\";",

To date, 32 Salmonella Typhimurium infections have been reported in 17 states. Five people were hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Sixteen of 23 ill people interviewed (70%) reported contact with pet hedgehogs before becoming sick. This outbreak strain is the same as outbreaks linked to hedgehogs in 2012 and in 2019 . A common source of hedgehogs has not been identified. Ill people reported buying hedgehogs from various sources, including pet stores, breeders, and online. Hedgehogs can carry Salmonella germs in their droppings while appearing healthy and clean. These germs can easily spread to their bodies, habitats, toys, bedding, and anything in the area where they live. People can become sick after they touch hedgehogs or anything in their habitats and then touch their face or mouth. Most people infected with Salmonella develop diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps 6 hours to 6 days after being exposed to the bacteria. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most people recover without treatment. In some people, the illness may be so severe that the patient is hospitalized. Salmonella infection may spread from the intestines to the bloodstream and then to other parts of the body. Children younger than 5, adults 65 and older, and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to have severe illness. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"5a1ee3a56a7cea750c549251bb712303\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B072Q4F6JG,B07RS4PK3J,B00C6OV63S,B00BTK17JI\";",

According to data from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), 2,028,233 total dengue cases have been reported in the Americas, including 753 deaths. The CDC reports the following 20 countries in the region are reporting higher-than-usual numbers of dengue cases, and travelers visiting these countries may be at increased risk: Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Honduras, Martinique, Mexico, Nicaragua, Peru, Saint Lucia , Saint Martin and Turks and Caicos Islands. Travelers to the Americas can protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites: using an EPA-registered insect repellent , wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors, and sleeping in an air-conditioned room or room with window screens or under an insecticide-treated bed net. CDC Yellow Book 2020: Health Information for International Travel Dengue is a disease caused by a virus spread through mosquito bites. The disease can take up to 2 weeks to develop with illness generally lasting less than a week. Health effects from dengue include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, rash, muscle and joint pain, and minor bleeding. Dengue can become severe within a few hours. Severe dengue is a medical emergency, usually requiring hospitalization. In severe cases, health effects can include hemorrhage (uncontrolled bleeding), shock (seriously low blood pressure), organ failure, and death. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"5a1ee3a56a7cea750c549251bb712303\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B072Q4F6JG,B07RS4PK3J,B00C6OV63S,B00BTK17JI\";",

The initial viruses were linked to the ongoing outbreak in Chad followed by local transmission, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. Close to 10 million doses of polio vaccine arrived Thursday in Khartoum, which will be used during the National Polio Campaign planned for October to immunize 8.6 million of the country’s children under the age of five. “We must protect children from the threat of polio, and the best way to do that is to increase the polio vaccination coverage and urge parents and communities to bring their children for vaccination to save them from the crippling disease”, said UNICEF Representative, Abdullah Fadil . “A little effort now can give children the best health care service that they need in their first years of life,” he remarked. “Vaccinating every child is the only way to stop this outbreak spreading further,” said Dr Ni’ma Saeed Abid, WHO Representative. “The pandemic has led to lower rates of routine immunization, placing children at even greater risk. We are committed to working with parents and caregivers to deliver vaccines, and urgently raise immunity levels.” “This is a multi-country outbreak has been active in 4 out of 7 neighboring countries with Sudan.

The majority of the newly confirmed cases were from the National Capital Region (NCR) with 825, the provinces of Batangas with 140, Laguna with 128, Rizal with 114, and Cavite with 102 infections. Sixty-four additional fatalities were reported putting the total at 5,840. Health Secretary Francisco T. Duque III received various health commodities donated by the World Health Organization (WHO), at the Department of Health (DOH) Central Office today. WHO Country Representative in the Philippines, Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe, turned over $3.1 million worth of personal protective equipment (PPEs) consisting of gowns (230,900 pcs), KN95 masks (405,000 pcs), face shields (187,800 pcs), goggles (159,540 pcs), gloves (489,000 pairs) and surgical masks (1,600,000 pcs). The WHO also handed over 350 units of oxygen concentrators, a medical device used for breathing-related disorders caused by low oxygen concentration in the blood. “The recent decline in cases in Metro Manila does not mean the pandemic is over, and now is not the time to relax. We must continue to build on this success in Metro Manila and support the control in newly emerging hotspots in other regions of the Philippines as we continue to save lives and ensure a gradual opening of the economy,” said Dr Abeyasinghe. “As we support the COVID-19 response of the Philippines, we need to ensure we detect cases early, quarantine close contacts and continue to expand healthcare pathways. WHO stands in solidarity with the Philippine government’s response to COVID-19 to protect the Filipino people. Secretary Duque expressed his thanks to WHO’s continued support to the country’sCOVID-19 National Action Plans and in managing pre-covid outbreaks like polio and measles “The way to defeat any pandemic is to collectively work and fight against it. With the WHO and other partner organizations, both from the public and private sector, fighting this battle alongside us, we are confident that we can beat this pandemic and we will recover as one,” said the Health Chief. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"e3db8b298d98ec6bb8467ceeee4a22a0\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07L68MRQL,B00CF5OHZ2,B07CNVVCXH,B0829MQ79Z\";",

According to a local media account , the individual has died from the mosquito-borne virus. The state has confirmed 36 EEE cases in animals across 15 counties this year–(1 Allegan, 1 Baraga,1 Barry, 1 Calhoun, 5 Clare, 3 Ionia, 1 Isabella, 2 Jackson, 3 Kent, 2 Livingston, 1 Mecosta, 8 Montcalm, 2 Newaygo, 4 Oakland, and 1 Tuscola). The Mid-Michigan District Health Department says Eastern Equine Encephalitis is a disease found in birds, and spread between birds by mosquitos. Certain species of mosquitos can also spread the disease from birds to some mammals, like horses, deer, and humans. The disease cannot be passed between mammals, such as from horse to horse or horse to human. People younger than age 15 and over age 50 are at greatest risk of severe disease following infection. Signs of EEE include the sudden onset of fever, chills, body and joint aches which can progress to severe encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). Eastern Equine Encephalitis infection in humans is one of the most dangerous mosquito-borne diseases in the United States.

Spread from the city of Abéché, Ouaddai Province has been reported to Biltine, Wadi Fira Province and Abdi and Gozbeida, Sila Province. One death has been reported in Kamina Health Centre, Abéché in an individual with major comorbidities. The World Health Organization says chikungunya is an arboviral disease transmitted to humans by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes. The disease is characterized by an abrupt onset of fever frequently accompanied by joint pain and inflammation which is often very debilitating and may last for several months, or even years. Fatalities associated with infection can occur but are typically rare and most reported in older adults with underlying medical conditions or perinatally-infected infants. Some patients might have a relapse of rheumatologic symptoms (e.g. polyarthralgia, polyarthritis, and tenosynovitis) in the months following acute illness.

        "main_text": "Researchers were able to link a community outbreak of COVID-19 in China to a source patient who likely spread the virus to fellow bus riders through the bus’s air conditioning system. “The possibility of airborne transmission has long been suspected, but with limited empirical evidence. Our study provided epidemiologic evidence of transmission over long distances, which was likely airborne,” said Ye Shen, an associate professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at UGA’s College of Public Health and lead author on the study. The study, which was published recently in JAMA Internal Medicine , calls into question the prevailing thought on how COVID-19 can spread. “It was largely believed that close contact through droplets is a major route of transmission for COVID-19. However, the widely adopted social distancing and hand washing did not effectively prevent the transmission globally. Instead, the number of new COVID-19 cases increased steadily,” said Shen. Shen and his co-authors worked with epidemiologists from two regional Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in China to trace infections following a large outdoor worship event in Zhejiang province. Some of the attendees, it turns out, took two buses to the event creating a unique natural experiment for the researchers. Both buses had closed windows and had air conditioning running, said Changwei Li, an associate professor of epidemiology at Tulane University and study co-author – but one bus carried a patient infected with the virus, and the other did not. Of the passengers who later got sick, the majority of them rode on the same bus as the source patient. Even though the two groups later mixed in with the larger crowd at the worship event, the number of new cases attributed to the event were much lower, suggesting that the bus was the major point of transmission. Further, some of the bus passengers who later showed symptoms of COVID-19, the authors found, were not sitting close to the infected passenger. These findings highlight scenarios where COVID-19 could be spread through fine aerosol particles being circulated in an enclosed space, and as the weather turns colder, Shen and Li hope this work will persuade more people to wear face masks in public areas, particularly in indoor spaces. “Understanding the transmission routes of COVID-19 is critical to contain the pandemic, so that effective prevention strategies can be developed targeting all potential transmission routes,” said Shen. “Our findings provide solid support for wearing face covering in enclosed environments with poor ventilation.” amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"f604ffce6ba7175ba884a1561900449d\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"1119382866,B084JKWJJX,1284136744,0367500639\";",

        "main_text": "Taiwan health officials reported two additional locally transmitted dengue fever cases today, bringing the total in the country this year to 41. The two new confirmed cases of local dengue fever were reported in the Three Gorges District of New Taipei City. They were a 50-year-old male in Zhongzhengli and a 60-year-old female in Jiaoxili. Both of them have no history of going abroad. Based on the activity of the two patient and the current situation of the epidemic situation, the site of infection was determined to be the Wuliao Jianshan Bamboo Garden, where a total of 25 people have been diagnosed in a cluster to date. In response to the clustering epidemic, local health and environmental protection agencies have continued to strengthen relevant prevention and control measures for Wuliaoli communities and bamboo shoots, including vector mosquito investigation, breeding source removal, chemical control, contact collection and inspection, and public health education. The Taiwan CDC reminded once again that after the rain, we should thoroughly eliminate breeding sources inside and outside the house to reduce the density of vector mosquitoes. In addition, during the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, people travel frequently from north to south. If people go to areas where dengue fever occurs, or need to spend a long time outdoors, please be sure to take anti-mosquito measures, such as wearing light-colored long-sleeved clothes, use government agencies for approval An anti-mosquito agent containing DEET or Picaridin; in case of suspected symptoms such as fever, headache, nausea, rash, posterior orbital pain and joint pain, seek medical attention as soon as possible and inform the history of travel activities ; If the medical institution encounters patients with suspected symptoms, the dengue fever NS1 rapid screening reagent can be used to assist in the diagnosis and early notification. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"ae41f9f5b84d64f9591ee3e2f9c9258f\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B07N9K5LND,B07TYN77NZ,B07R591TJ9,B089B1QHFR\";",

During the past two weeks, Spain has recorded nearly 130,000 new cases , bringing the country total to 778,607 cases , making it one of the hardest hit countries in the world and the most cases seen in any European country. In Madrid, 1,586 new infections were reported Wednesday, or 40 percent of the country’s total for that day. The Spanish Ministry of Health announced Wednesday new coordinated actions in public health to respond to the increases in the outbreak: Specifically, it is established that it is necessary to implement new measures in populations with more than 100,000 inhabitants that have an incidence greater than 500 cases per 100,000 people in the last 14 days, a positivity of diagnostic tests for active infection greater than 10% and who are in autonomous communities with an ICU bed occupancy by Covid-19 patients greater than 35% of the usual staff. The entry and exit of people from the affected municipalities will be restricted, except for those displacements, adequately justified, that occur due to assistance to health centers, services and establishments, compliance with labor, professional, business or legal obligations, assistance to university, teaching and educational centers, including schools for early childhood education and assistance and care for the elderly, minors, dependents, people with disabilities or especially vulnerable people, among others.

Officials note that Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease and people (and animals) can get infected when they are exposed to the urine of infected animals. They can also get infected from water, soil, or food contaminated with infected animal urine. Leptospirosis bacteria can enter the body through skin or mucous membranes (eyes, nose, or mouth). Travelers to Fiji should take the following steps to prevent leptospirosis: The good news is officials in Fiji report there has been a decline in leptospirosis cases from the peak of more than 100 cases a week to less than 20 cases per week. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"b108f7e80b2f423977f08868235d5420\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"3662450585,019092893X,1786572141,0241280702\";",

        "main_text": "Alaska state health officials are reporting the second known novel orthopoxvirus case, aka “Alaskapox” in a resident of Fairbanks. In August, a woman presented with the following symptoms: A small grey lesion on her left upper arm, followed by erythema approximately 4 days later. She reported tender axillary adenopathy, shoulder pain, fatigue, and subjective fever at night. PCR testing performed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified it as a generic orthopoxvirus and sequencing determined it belonged to the lineage as the first ever case reported in a different Fairbanks woman in 2015. The patient had not traveled outside of Alaska for the past 3 years, but she did travel to Southcentral Alaska approximately 3 weeks before symptom onset. She reported that none of her family members or coworkers had any recent history of international travel. At the time of symptom onset, the patient lived with two cats. She reported that one of the cats captured and killed small mammals outside her residence, but the patient denied ever touching any of the small mammals.

Both cases occurred during mid- to late summer in residents of forested areas near Fairbanks. While the similar time of year may be purely coincidental, it may also reflect the fact that small mammal populations are likely at or near their peak population size in late summer and that humans in Interior Alaska spend more time outdoors during the summer than other times of year. Orthopoxvirus is a genus of double-stranded DNA viruses that infect a variety of animals, including humans, cattle, cats, and rodents. Virologists have proposed that the lineage found in these two cases represents a new species of Orthopoxvirus, which they named “Alaskapox virus” Got Smallpox?",

Most people infected with dengue have mild or no symptoms. Those that do develop symptoms recover after about one week. The common symptoms of dengue are fever and one or more of the following symptoms : headache; eye pain (typically behind the eyes); muscle, joint, or bone pain; rash; nausea and vomiting; or unusual bleeding (nose or gum bleed, small red spots under the skin, or unusual bruising). Severe dengue can occur resulting in shock, internal bleeding, and death. If you or a family member develop the mentioned symptoms, visit your health care provider or local clinic.

        "main_text": "The full spectrum and distribution of the severity of COVID-19 symptoms are not well understood. Some infected people may experience severe infections resulting in viral pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome, and death, while others remain completely asymptomatic or develop mild, nonspecific symptoms. To better understand the proportion of people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and never develop any symptoms, as well as the proportion of people who are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis but develop symptoms later, researchers systematically reviewed literature using a database of SARS-CoV-2 evidence between March and June, 2020. The authors then analysed 79 studies reporting empirical data on 6,616 people, 1,287 of whom were defined as asymptomatic, in order to determine the proportion of infected people who never developed symptoms. While the study was limited by its inability to ascertain the impact of false negatives, the researchers were able to estimate that 20% (95% CI 17-25) of COVID-19 infections remained asymptomatic during follow-up. Accurate estimations of true asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections are critical to understanding SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the population level and for populations to adopt appropriately tailored public health strategies. Future research should include prospective longitudinal studies that document symptom status. Improved accuracy of serological tests is also needed to reduce the number of false negatives. Since each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 is initially asymptomatic, the proportion that will go on to develop symptoms is estimated to be around 80%, suggesting that presymptomatic transmission may significantly contribute to overall SARS CoV-2 epidemics. According to the authors, “The findings of this systematic review of publications early in the pandemic suggests that most SARS-CoV-2 infections are not asymptomatic throughout the course of infection. The contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic infections to overall SARS-CoV-2 transmission means that combination prevention measures, with enhanced hand and respiratory hygiene, testing and tracing, and isolation strategies and social distancing, will continue to be needed. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"1b351500771c7a0c2e4dd5ee42bc20ce\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"0393346617,1589881222,1418021032,1555819257\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"Shop Related Products\";",

        "main_text": "An outbreak of Vibrio parahaemolyticus, related to shellfish, has been declared following nine confirmed cases in the the Canadian province of New Brunswick. “As Public Health continues to investigate the specific cause of the outbreak I am advising all New Brunswickers to ensure that they obtain shellfish and other seafood from a licensed establishment or harvest shellfish from fishing zones which are currently open by Fisheries and Oceans Canada,” said Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health. “Cook all shellfish such as mussels, oysters and clams thoroughly before eating.” Vibrio parahaemolyticus is commonly associated with the consumption and handling of raw shellfish such as oysters, clams, and mussels. The confirmed cases have been reported in the northern and eastern parts of the province. New Brunswick typically averages two to three cases of vibrio parahaemolyticus a year. “New Brunswickers are encouraged to enjoy healthy seafoods such as clams, mussels, and oysters but should be aware that warmer temperatures may increase the risks of bacteria in these foods,” said Russell. “The risk of food poisoning can be minimized by following some simple food safety guidelines such as washing your hands before and after handling these foods; store raw shellfish and seafood at 4 C in the refrigerator or on ice before cooking and refrigerate leftovers promptly.” Vibrio parahaemolyticus are a naturally occurring bacteria in sea water. The bacteria can grow in shellfish such as clams, oysters and mussels when seawater temperatures are warmer such as in summer months. Handling or eating raw or undercooked shellfish can result in illness. Symptoms usually appear within 12 to 24 hours after a person becomes infected. Most people who become ill have diarrhea, but they can also have headache, nausea, vomiting and fever. Symptoms usually last less than a week. The illness is not spread from person to person.

        "main_text": "In a follow-up on the chikungunya outbreak in Chad , about 3,000 additional cases have been reported in the north-central African country. From July through 20 September 2020, a total of 27,540 cases were reported in three provinces, distributed as follows: 24,302 cases in the health district of Abéché, 3237 cases in the health district of Biltine, and one case in the health district of Abdi. One death has been reported to date in district of Abéché. In July 2020 health authorities were alerted to the occurrence of a disease-causing high fever, headache, intense and disabling joint pain, and sometimes associated with vomiting. It was eventually determined to be the chikungunya virus once it was confirmed in a 63-year-old female farmer. She had no reported travel outside of Abéché district. A total of 13 samples from Abéché district, Ouaddai Province, were sent for analysis at the N’Djamena mobile laboratory on 12 August 2020 and 11 samples tested positive for chikungunya virus. The World Health Organization says chikungunya is an arboviral disease transmitted to humans by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes. The disease is characterized by an abrupt onset of fever frequently accompanied by joint pain and inflammation which is often very debilitating and may last for several months, or even years. Fatalities associated with infection can occur but are typically rare and most reported in older adults with underlying medical conditions or perinatally-infected infants. Some patients might have a relapse of rheumatologic symptoms (e.g. polyarthralgia, polyarthritis, and tenosynovitis) in the months following acute illness. There is no specific antiviral treatment or commercially available vaccine for chikungunya. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"c3bfec89865bb17939d4e30fa1dec914\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"3319827049,1524743429,B00C0ZP2O2,B010AFV0LM\"; Aedes aegypti mosquito",

        "headline": "Philippines nears 300K COVID-19 cases, Baguio to pilot rapid antigen testing - Outbreak News Today",
        "main_text": "The Philippines Department of Health (DOH) reported an additional 2,630 new COVID-19 cases Friday, bringing the country total to 299,361. The Metro Manila area accounted for more than 1,000 of the new cases. 69 new deaths reported today brought the total to 5,196 to date. According to health officials, the number of COVID-19 deaths has continued to taper off, with the highest number of deaths last recorded on August 6 to 13, based on a four-week moving average. Today, the DOH reported that Baguio City has been chosen for the pilot use of rapid antigen testing following recommendations to study its diagnostic capacity to screen for COVID-19 cases. According to Health Secretary Francisco T. Duque III, Baguio City is the preferred pilot site because of its model governance in managing the spread and containment of the coronavirus as it leads the way for aggressive and organized contact tracing in the Philippines, while at the same time increasing the operational efficiency of its health management system. Antigen tests are used to determine current or active infections among patients. They collect and use swab samples to test a person under monitoring for COVID-19 in a process similar to the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests. However, unlike RT-PCR, tests that can take up to three days to process results, said antigen tests have only about 4-6 hours turnaround time for release of results. Sec. Duque explains the objective of the pilot use: “It will help us assess whether rapid antigen tests can be adopted for official use or not. This pilot use will also determine if these tests are best performed when a person is already in the early stages of infection.” To date, the World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend rapid antigen as a screening method. PHILIPPINES BUSINESS AND INVESTMENTS WITH GRACE TOLENTINO, CHAIRMAN, BORACAY BEACH However, the health chief explained that the tests may be used under certain conditions, such as an outbreak or in locations that need testing but do not have access to RT-PCR tests. Meanwhile, Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong, also known as the Contact Tracing Czar, expressed his support for the DOH’s implementation of the pilot use on his city and pointed out where the first tests will be conducted. He said, “Antigen testing can be piloted among the asymptomatic close contacts of the confirmed cases in the two barangays, in which the expert groups were amenable.” All data will be given to the DOH and the expert groups to analyze and come up with a conclusion and policy recommendation. “The people and officialdom of Baguio City are grateful to the Department of Health for having chosen the city to pilot the antigen test. We hope that the results of the pilot test will contribute in enriching the Omnibus guidelines governing the use of the antigen as an alternative COVID detection tool that will speed up efforts to prevent the spread of the virus in our communities,” Mayor Magalong said. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"a89d0ec580f4cea7b5822b998a743592\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"1623962072,039951144X,1780055684,019092893X\"; “The city will continue to be open to whatever decision of the health department in further enhancing the prevention, detection, isolation, treatment, and re-integration (PDITR) efforts to combat the spread of the virus in our midst,” he added. Mayor Magalong also proposed that the test, if proven successful, will also be conducted on tourists who will visit the city once it reopens for business and to leisure travelers, especially from Region 1, on October 1. Sec. Duque thanked the Mayor for his collaboration and assistance, saying that they were vital in helping the DOH progress in its COVID-19 campaign. “Baguio City and its upcoming reopening have shown us what can be accomplished if the LGU and its people observe and operationalize minimum health protocols. Its management of COVID-19 has made it the most suitable place for pilot use which potentially can help us speed up our accurate screening of positive patients, and thus create an environment to make them and their loved ones safer,” the Health Secretary said.",

Earlier this month, Brazoria County Health officials contacted city officials about a 6-year-old child that was hospitalized with a Naegleria fowleri infection. Based on what the information from the family, water samples were collected from the Lake Jackson Civic Center Splash Pad and tested negative by a private lab. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were contacted and more intensive testing was performed to include from the splash pad and water at the child’s home. It was announced that three of 11 water samples tested preliminarily positive for the parasite–the splash pad storage tank, a hose at the child’s home and a dead end fire hydrant near the splash pad. Officials note that chlorine was detected in the water samples. The Brazosport Water Authority issued a Do-Not-Use water advisory Friday for 10 other areas and Lake Jackson and today lifted the advisory for all areas except Lake Jackson.

        "main_text": "There is not a clear top-down solution to the COVID-19 pandemic. A vaccine may not be available for another 12 months, national lock-downs threaten to damage economies and time has been lost through misjudged interventions.  A resurgence of the virus coincides with winter in the northern hemisphere, and in many countries, there is still insufficient capacity for testing and tracing. Living with COVID-19 depends, more than ever, on social responsibility to comply with preventive measures, to be vigilant and to help to protect the vulnerable. Internationally, the focus is beginning to shift towards strengthening the role of communities, guided by the evidence from the social and behavioural sciences and experiences from other disease outbreaks. An understanding of the socio-cultural context is essential to maintain low community transmission by influencing human behaviour, to engage with hard-to-reach groups and to target people and settings that present a high risk of spreading the virus. Mass gatherings such as raves and protests, including anti vax, for example, have occurred around the world without the authorities being able to properly engage with people to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Living with COVID-19 will depend on tailored interventions to reach those who cannot or will not maintain low community transmission. Community-based organisations, leaders and local champions have worked tirelessly to deliver a range of activities to help people to empower themselves to protect against COVID-19. Volunteerism has also been a common feature in many countries to help to shield and support the vulnerable and to protect others in the community. Community-based organisations are able to utilise a broad network of contacts, an essential aspect of any outbreak response, that can ´fast-track´ building trust and create a bridge for collaboration . A recognition of, and stronger funding streams for, community-based organisations, must quickly become a core part of the public health response to the pandemic. Harnessing the potential of communities will depend on a government recognition of their importance and on stronger funding streams. Harnessing the potential of communities can be enhanced by building trust including through the use of reliable sources of evidence-based information and by providing opportunities for people to engage in a dialogue about the risks of infection. ´Online COVID coaching´, for example, can be used to build a relationship to raise awareness about the  barriers to maintain personal protection. A personal plan provides a new direction to modify behaviour and to visualize the potential for change with realistic goals and by tracking progress. Learning to live with COVID-19 Living with COVID-19 will depend on harnessing the potential of individuals, families and communities. The pandemic will continue to have a devastating impact on the health of the population and on national economies unless we do everything we can and use every opportunity and every tool to control the spread of the virus. It is important for every government to understand that it is not too late to harness the potential of individuals, families and communities to become a key part of the ongoing response. Knowing what we do know, that working with communities is critical to the success of a disease outbreak response, the question is: Why has the potential of communities not been a key feature of the response during the COVID-19  pandemic? We have not learned from the lessons and earlier mistakes made during previous disease outbreaks and did not engage with communities at the beginning of the present pandemic. There is no excuse not to actively involve people, however, harnessing the potential of communities has not been widely embraced by governments. Adopting a paternalistic, top-down approach to addressing the outbreak at a national level may be a decision that many live to regret as the virus continues to spread within countries and around the world. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"a0349c4b975322a8d33969af0db94187\";\namzn_assoc_design = \"in_content\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"B075LNZ7T3,1352005298\"; In summary, we can begin to harness the potential of individuals, families and communities to protect themselves and others from COVID-19 by: COVID-19 pandemic: Ten things we must do better in health promotion Communities and COVID-19: Perspectives from a health promotion expert Outbreaks and the role of health promotion",

Brucellosis is a contagious disease of animals that also affects humans. The disease is also known as Bang’s Disease. In humans, it’s known as Undulant Fever and Malta fever. Got Smallpox? Brucellosis is one of the most serious diseases of livestock, considering the damage done by the infection in animals. Decreased milk production, weight loss , loss of young, infertility, and lameness are some of the affects on animals.

First, individuals that work with infected animals that have not been vaccinated against brucellosis. This would include farmers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians. Related: College microbiology classes linked to Salmonella Typhimurium outbreak They get infected through direct contact or aerosols produced by the infected animal tissue. B. abortus and B. suis are most common. The second way is through ingesting unpasteurized dairy products. Brucellosis is also an occupational hazard to laboratory workers who inappropriately handle specimens or have an accident or spill. Brucella is highly infectious in the aerosolized form . If someone gets infected with Brucella, the incubation period is about 2-3 weeks, though it could be months. Fever, night sweats, severe headache and body aches and other non-specific symptoms may occur. Acute and chronic brucellosis can lead to complications in multiple organ systems. The skeletal, central nervous system, respiratory tract, the liver, heart, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts can all be affected. Untreated brucellosis has a fatality rate of 5%.",

Usually, there are no respiratory symptoms. Symptoms of Dengue will appear within 14 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. Dengue fever is not contagious but is transmitted by the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito. The emergence of these Dengue cases reinforces the importance for the public to prevent insect bites and to take basic precautions to help limit exposure. These measures include intact windows and screens and the use of air conditioning, keeping the area around your residence free from containers that collect water, wearing protective clothing, and the appropriate use of insect repellents after applying sunscreen. Spray out outdoor plants on a regular basis, such as bromeliads and crotons.

        "main_text": "According to the Swedish Public Health Agency’s and the Medical Products Agency’s joint annual report for 2019 , adherence to the vaccination program remains high: 97 percent of two-year-olds were fully vaccinated in 2019. Last year, not a single case of rubella and tetanus was reported, and only isolated cases of cutaneous diphtheria. Pneumococcal infections among children under the age of two remain at a low level. There were also fewer measles cases, 20, after two years with relatively many due to major outbreaks. About 30 people fell ill with mumps , most aged 25-39 years. The total number of cases of pertussis increased slightly compared with 2018. Since 2014, however, pertussis among infants has decreased significantly, and a small decrease was also seen in 2019 compared with the year before. In addition, an increasing proportion of girls are also vaccinated against HPV : At the end of 2019, 86 percent of all 13-year-old girls were vaccinated with at least one dose of HPV. vaccine and 80 percent with two doses. In September 2019, vaccination against rotavirus infection was introduced in the childhood vaccination program, and from the autumn term 2020, vaccination against HPV is offered to all children, regardless of gender, in year five. Vaccination against rotavirus has got off to a good start. Vaccination coverage was close to 90 percent among the children who were the first to be covered by the vaccination program. “We have a well-functioning and stable vaccination program that we must take care of”, says Sören Andersson, unit manager at the unit for vaccination programs at the Swedish Public Health Agency. amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"outbre-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"manual\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_title = \"\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"589b509262d3e549c7d0f72176382925\";\namzn_assoc_asins = \"0062947494,B000ROKXVA,0465082963,0465057969\";",
